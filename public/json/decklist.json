Weyland has <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n<p>I must admit, playing Jinteki PE the main plan is flatlining and I wasn't taking risks mandatory for a shell game, with multiple servers of open traps and open agendas. I didn't understand that and turned to HB for a glacier approach, with most of my games ending with a tower of ICE on a single server, sometimes up to 5 cards of different subtypes (avoiding more than two Code Gates, because of <a href=\"en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade's<\/a> ability keeping its strength). A Code Gate plus a couple of Barriers and maaaybe a Sentry somewhere in the fort, worked best.

I turned to HB for a glacier approach, with most of my games ending with a tower of ICEs on a single server, sometimes up to 5 cards of different subtypes (avoiding more than two Code Gates, because of <a href=\"en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade's<\/a> ability keeping its strength). A Code Gate plus a couple of Barriers and maaaybe a Sentry somewhere in the fort, worked best. I usually avoid sentries in the beginning because they lack ETR and the runner usually runs naked in the beginning. I could lay them there as investment but what about <a href=\"en\/card\/01020\">Forged Activation Orders<\/a>? They destroy the element of surprise mid-game. Long story short, my deck was packed with ICE and economy, Adonis, Melange, PADs, Beanstalks, Hedge Funds. Nothing else, no traps, no tagging, not even upgrades.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything was going better against my Netrunner buddy as I started winning more often, until I found some new players to test the deck and lost miserably. One day I lost at 11-0 agenda points at a single game, when one guy run into R&amp;D with <a href=\"en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> and found two 3p agendas!! These runners were attacking aggressively every turn and I finally learned how much can <a href=\"en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a> hurt. Like a big guy kicking you right on the balls and then going retard, just so he can kick you again next round going full retard with another Stimhack. And then I remembered Jinteki...Good old punishing Jinteki, net-hurting those f***ing runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>I went home crying like a little bitch just to prepare for revenge. I packed my deck with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snares<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01076\">Data Mines<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01075\">Chums<\/a>...and guess what, it worked like a charm. After the runner stimhacked a remote server packed with ICE just to stumble upon an installed Snare...oh man, bitch got her revenge and tasted some run-tears.<\/p>\n\n<p>I revised the deck a few times since that game, because I was only carrying the min 45 cards and got agenda flood multiple games resulting in a 50-50 win. In a few occasions I was forced to play shell game just to get rid of a few agendas from HQ, like installing an open agenda and a trap under ICE and it worked. Then I took it even further as to install two agendas out of hand advancing both of them next turn. The runner stole the one and got scared to check the other. I left it there double-advanced for many turns , managed to score another and came back to it to finish the game. Boy, that was fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long story short, this deck can be played both glacier or shell, depending on opening hand. As far as revisions go, I ditched the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01076\">Data Mines<\/a> for some <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebugs<\/a> since this deck isn't primarily focused on net-damaging the runner and one point net damage can't hurt much, but a triple advanced <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">PJ<\/a> can destroy him, even a double adv. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">PJ<\/a> can set the runner far behind. I wasn't sure about <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries<\/a> either, going back and forth on removing them. At the end I kept them in deck to help with Agenda flood. I also included <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a> to recycle either the traps or the economy and ditched <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archers<\/a> for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooths<\/a>. I couldn't wait for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a> to rez an Archer and Tollbooth is a great alternative for keeping the runner poor without having to forfeit agendas or hoping on scoring a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">PR<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">AM<\/a> also saved me a few times from <a href=\"en\/card\/01001\">Noise's<\/a> ability, trashing an agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for agendas in general, don't use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test's<\/a> feature...it sucks! Unless you see your deck thin and not much ICE on the table, then maaaaybe you'll get lucky and find ICE on the top 3 cards of R&amp;D. Otherwise you'll end up with one cheap-ass ICE just discovered, rezzed over the Archives because the other two cards were agendas, or even end up with 2 agendas and an econ. card discarded just like that...with no protection whatsoever and your deck 3 cards thinner. And who's gonna save you? Only <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">AM<\/a> IF you're extremely lucky to have it in HQ. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">Private Security Force<\/a> also sucks, only good for <a href=\"en\/card\/01080\">NBN<\/a> and <a href=\"en\/card\/01093\">Weyland<\/a> in the core set, but what can you do?

My turn: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign's<\/a> free credit, adv+scoring <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">PSF<\/a> and two meat damage right there. His next turn had to get rid of the tags with two clicks and draw cards, thus <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">PSF<\/a> can rarely be useful. What am I saying, rethinking it...it still sucks balls! <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">PR<\/a> FTW in this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>A comment on a few HB cards I removed...<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, this card is useless to HB in the core set.

{"identity":"images/Whizzard.png","id":1003,"name":"Swiss Army Whizzard","creation":"2013-12-16 17:53:20","description":"<p>So, this is the deck I've won 2 seasons of our local league with and placed rather well in some tournaments, with only some minor alterations over the past 6 months or so. <\/p>\n\n<p>I feel this is a deck that's easy to play and difficult to master. Some of your optimal plays will be far from obvious, and it requires you to be able to read the board reasonably well. Most of the games I've lost with this come from incorrectly evaluating whether to parasite an ice or not - this is especially true when you contemplate whether to parasite something like an Archer that'll take 6 turns to die. Your most powerful plays usually require setup over multiple turns, so the corp will see them coming... but that's ok. Think of it as slowly and deliberately closing down your opponent's avenues to victory, as opposed to trying to trick out a cheap win. You have quite a few different moves you can make, many of which actually require similar tools - so even by dropping cards on the table, you're not commiting yourself to one course too much. Often-times I'll drop a nerve agent on the table just to make them ice HQ at the expense of RnD, for instance... and it's totally fine that the nerve agent will sit there unused for like 5 turns, because once its time comes, it's already been moved into position. <\/p>\n\n<p>Don't get locked into a mindset of \"I have to do X to win\". Remember - the key concept here is flexibility and multiple avenues to victory. Those deja-vus aren't in there <em>just<\/em> to recur Siphons. Sometimes you'll be able to siphon, and it'll be cool. Other-times you won't, and it'll be cool too - you can recur parasites, do multiple demo runs in one turn, recover from Archer facechecks and do all other kinds of cool stuff. Just chill, play it cool, keep your hand at 5 usable cards (if you get duplicates of Grimoire and Djinn, overdraw and ditch 'em), take some credits occasionally and you'll be fine. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:<\/strong> \nIf you don't have an econ card, mulligan. Doesn't matter which one you get (yes, even Liberated Accounts is fine), just have one. Armitage is quite possibly the best one here, because it'll give you enough sustained econ to pass the time while you draw into more econ. <\/p>\n\n<p>Early-game should be spent grabbing cheap accesses where you can and making the corp rez ICE - you have the best facechecking breaker in the game, better put it to good use. Don't be afraid to play a Datasucker and facecheck ice that's possibly going to trash it - you have three of them, and can recycle at will. If they rez, they're losing much more money than you are. If they don't, your free accesses just started enabling some of your really brutal midgame plays. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mid-game, just explore whatever openings the corp and your card draws are giving you. Possibilities include, but are not limited to: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getting a complete rig out ASAP <\/li>\n<li>running naked\/minimalistic and accessing cards left and right <\/li>\n<li>clicking through Eli to Siphon for some easy cash <\/li>\n<li>playing tag-happily, trashing Psychographics, Closed Accounts and Scorcheds with Imp to take the edge off things <\/li>\n<li>sitting back on a pile of Liberated Account credits to make it really hard for the corp to estimate where you can and can't get <\/li>\n<li>playing for time by farming datasucker counters and rezzing ice while drawing into stuff you need <\/li>\n<li>preparing for some later-turn insanity by setting up grimoire, djinn and fishing for some parts you're missing <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Late-game really depends on what you've been doing up until this point, which tools are setup and how the corp board looks. If you can't think of anything better, you can still play for time with a couple well-aimed Parasites to force frequent purges. Eventually you'll either win or lose, as is the nature of the game :) <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for some card choice explanations: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Whizzard? Noise is so much better!\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, he really isn't. I know, I've tried. Basically, Whizzard's ability comes in handy in two situations: to dig deeper into RnD (which is a good thing) and to get dangerous things off the table without having to wait for the corp to rez 'em before it's worthwhile (which means you can be the one setting the tempo in those situations, you don't have to be the passive one). <\/p>\n\n<p>The real eye-opener to this was a random comment on BGG that went something along the lines of \"so many people say that Whizzard's ability totally shuts down their decks... good thing noone plays him.\" So I decided to change that. \nAlso, I really despise Noise's super-annoying tendency of giving you random bullshit wins in games which you lost because of your own mistakes, thus leading you to never really learning from them :) <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why no Vamp?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I used to play Vamp, it isn't worth it unless you're going all in on the strategy. Keeping someone continually at zero (which is the only scenario Vamp is really good for) requires a lot more commitment during deck construction than I was comfortable here (for one thing, it'd require a lot more econ) - I'd leave too many other cards out, and would become way too dependent on being able to get through into HQ. Keeping stuff unrezzed is neat, blowing it up after it gets rezzed is neater. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why no Joshua and no DLR?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Because I have better things to do with my time than spend click in a suboptimal fashion. To make this work, I'd have to dedicate 6 slots to it, and those 6 slots are much better used elsewhere. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is, of course, the possiblity of running just Joshua, for those matchups where I go tag-happy... but that would be 3 more cards I'd hate to draw in matchups where I really don't want to keep tags. Building to make him work in those situations would require some more moving parts. Hence, I went for flexbility instead. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Djinn isn't worth the slots\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe the ability to conjure up Medium and Nerve Agent at will is already worth 2 credits and 2 cardslots, not even counting the extra memory you're getting and the fishing for other viruses <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"2 Crypsis AND a full breaker suite?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What can I say, I tended to be rather unlucky with my card draws, so this is to improve consistency and early thread. I used to run one Crypsis (for tutoring purposes only), but I actually did lose a game after drawing over 30 cards and still being unable to get through a goddamn Ice Wall :) <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, if I really wanted to fit one specific card in here, the second Crypsis would be the first card to get cut. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Atman and not X?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The last 3 influence points used to be Levy, to have the ability to keep Siphoning longer... then I realized that an Atman would be a much better choice. For one, it's another breaker to draw into early, potentially giving you massive board presence. Also, it neatly solves some issues you might run into - vs. Weyland, drop it at 6 and stop caring about Archer. Vs. HB, drop it at str 4 and wave merrily as you're passing those \"taxing\" Ichis and Elis. Vs. Jinteki, take care of both Neural Katana and Wall of Static with one breaker... the list goes on. Since it's a singleton, you won't see it every game, but when you do see it, it'll be massively useful, I promise you that. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, for added hilarity, sometimes people see you play an early Atman, automatically assume you're playing three of them and then stare in shocked disbelief when you start repeatedly siphoning them (\"he can't possibly play more than one siphon, he's already spent 9 influence on Atmen!\"). Priceless, really. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Demolition Run?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Because Demo Run is easily one of the most underrated tools in the Anarch toolbox. I think part of that is because people keep thinking Anarch = Noise, and Demo Run seems kinda redundant with his ability. Don't be that guy. This card enables both super-deep RnD digs (the good old \"run, run, demo run, run\" turn) and shuts down combos really hard (nerve agent, surge, demo run their hand, watch 'em toss all those hoarded Biotics and weep bitter tears of despair). \nOh, and if you're playing against Jinteki, remember that Demo Run means you can nuke that Hokusai for free, while you're at it :D <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Isn't 3x Grimoire excessive?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Flexibility means options. Having options means having stuff already installed before you actually need it. Having stuff installed means needing memory. \nAlso, Grimoire is a huge Surge enabler - which brings me to... <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Surge?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, Surge. It's so massively useful I've went up to 3 Grimoires just to be able to trigger it more often. Examples: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>play a Sucker and Surge it to stop being shut out of servers after a purge <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Medium before a Demo run to pretty much deck a corp unexpectedly (this usually just fishes out 7 points before that happens, though :D) <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Nerve Agent after a Siphon run, go right back and steal all their stuff <\/li>\n<li>alternatively, the same play but with an Imp\/Demo run to get rid of the cards that could make you lose (Scorched, Psycho, possibly Closed Accounts) <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Parasite to make a Tollbooth\/whatever go <em>poof<\/em> much sooner <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Crypsis to get into that place you wouldn't be able to get into otherwise <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Tag-me with just 2 Carapaces?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah. Either don't go into tag-me mode until you hit one (you have plenty other things to do to pass the time, like farming Armitages and installing threatening-looking stuff), or just use destruction to get rid of the cards you'd need the third Carapace against. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Liberated Accounts is useless when tagged\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, it's not - you just have to install it as the first action and then clear it thrice. It's basically the runner version of a Melange turn, and as an added bonus, it leaves a card on the table that's both tempting to trash and tempting to leave (and both of those options are fine with you). Same thing with Armitage, although the investment is smaller there, so you can potentially spend an Armitage just to make them spend 2 credits and a click, especially if you need to play for time for some reason. <\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>There, that's about all that came to mind. If you have any questions, ask away!<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01002":3,"01003":2,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01018":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02081":2,"03040":1}},

{"identity":"images/CT.png","id":808,"name":"Big Girls Play With Monoliths","creation":"2013-12-06 10:31:43","description":"<p>This decklist originally came into being as part of the first Turing Test over at CardGameDB - http:\/\/www.cardgamedb.com\/index.php\/index.html\/_\/android-netrunner\/turing-test-r892. If you aren't familiar with it, go have a read, it's interesting. Basically, the question was \"How fast can you conveniently have Monolith and a full breaker suite up?\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Short version: Insane card draw + Freelance Coding Contract to get a Full Rig With Monolith\u2122 set up early, then recurring siphons and RnD lock for the win. <\/p>\n\n<p>First pass through the deck should usually be chucking most programs to FCCs - don't hesitate to install what you need to apply early pressure on the corp though. Often, I'll install Magnum Opus to get Monolith out sooner - if I don't, it usually delays the big beast not because of a lack of money, but because I'll take longer to get the 3 programs to install (since I need to be chucking them to make said money). <\/p>\n\n<p>Funny thing about Monolith - it doesn't matter which programs you install with it, it always pulls its weight. Even if you do a triple Cloak play, it's still worth it: you save 3 actions and 3 credits, so valuing each click at 2 credits you're only paying 9 for Monolith - and you're getting the memory you need to make this rig work, along with a sweet \"let's facecheck cerebral overwriters and run through Januses\" ability. And this is just the worst-case scenario - most of the time, you'll be getting a much sweeter deal, with one of the cards being either a Gordian or at the very least a Dagger. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, about the rig. It always consists of:\n- one Cloak\n- Dagger\n- Corroder\n- Gordian Blade\n- Magnum Opus<\/p>\n\n<p>That eats up 6 of your 8 available memory. The last 2 units are circumstantial:\n- If your opponent is Jinteki, you want a Net Shield\n- Unless there's a complete lack of Sentries with the 1-3 Strength range, you want a Mimic (I really can't stress just how hard this breaker owns Caduceus and Katana, two sentries that could potentially become a problem)\n- Fill the rest of your memory with Cloaks<\/p>\n\n<p>Once that happens, just establish RnD lock, recur Siphons, farm the extra copies of programs for credits or damage prevention, and you should be all set. <\/p>\n\n<p>Edit 2013\/12\/06: Added a Nerve Agent, taking out one Corroder. Basically, sacrificing early-game consistency for a solution to those moments in the late-game where it all hangs on whether they got an agenda into their hand before I established R&amp;D lock. Don't be afraid to trash a Cloak or Magnum Opus to play the Nerve Agent - most of the time, the Sure Gambles and FCCs will give you enough money to function well, and you can always install over the Nerve Agent once it has played its part.<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01018":2,"01034":3,"01043":3,"01044":3,"01045":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02046":1,"02087":3,"02107":2,"03033":3,"03035":3,"03036":2,"03041":3,"03042":3}},

It was undefeated at 4-0 for the day.  I'll be putting together a tournament report in the near future and link it in the comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's fairly similar to the Gabe deck I've been playing for several months now, though I swapped out 3 x Parasites and 3 x Datasuckers for 3 x Knight, 1 x Mimic, an extra Armitage Codebusting, and an extra Corroder.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power Shutdown and Wraparound are the primary reasons I made the switch.  With Power Shutdown, I lost my only Corroder in a tournament last month after the Corp played back-to-back Power Shutdowns to nuke a Faerie and Corroder.  With Wraparound, I typically run a single Corroder and Parasite low-strength ETR ice until I draw into or Special Order the Corroder; a strategy that Wraparound nicely circumvents.  So the extra copy of Corroder seemed like a nice play.  The other huge benefit of running Knights is more flexibility in the early-game.  Knight plays like an Inside Job, where you're virtually guaranteed to get into a server of your choosing (useful for HQ runs with Account Siphons or Emergency Shutdowns, or for R&amp;D runs with Indexing), inevitably followed by the Corp trashing that troublesome ice to work as a pseudo-Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I'm still not sure whether I prefer the Knight version or Parasite version of this deck... each has their own pros\/cons and they're both favorites of mine.  I've only been messing with this version for a couple of weeks, so we'll see if I tend to favor one or the other after more playtime for this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the tournament report for this event:\nhttp:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1146823\/store-championship-the-yellow-king-1st-place-t<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":3,"02043":3,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":3}},
{"identity":"images/NBNTWiY.png","id":2957,"name":"TWIY Astrobiotics","creation":"2014-03-08 09:38:04","description":"<p>Foreward: I'll be honest, this deck is dumb. If you want to have fun with quirky shenanigans, this isn't for you. Astrobiotics is a quintessential Spike deck. My opponents have left once they see what I'm doing, they've flamed how much of a bore it is, and I've scared away a couple of new players (sorry! I do always put [Adv] in my OCTGN room :\/). This deck has an extremely hard time losing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've spent months analyzing TWIY trying to figure out how to unlock its true potential. Many conclusions I've drawn won't be new to many (Biotic Laboring a Astroscript is teh shit), but many I haven't seen reflected as much as I think should. Anyways, let's begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I'm going to make a bold claim: TWIY improves as the deck approaches 40 cards. TWIY is all about consistency and speed - the more you fine-tune both, the better your deck becomes (even if only marginally - it adds up). There's nothing worse than spending half your game drawing without seeing an Astroscript or fast advance tool<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, as many of you are aware, cutting to 40 cards increases your agenda density and you lack the deckspace needed to incorporate ice, econ, and the tools you need, causing some opening hands to lose the game for you. Anonymous Tip was designed for TWIY. Running three of them, you have a 40% chance of starting with one, granting you an eight-card starting hand. Anonymous Tip provides opening flexibility - its deckslot functions not only as a draw accelerator, but also as either ice or economy since it gives you a second opportunity in a bad opening hand. This Andromeda-like effect all but eliminated bad openings in this deck (too bad it doesn't come with an improved mulligan).<\/p>\n\n<p>So what constitutes a good opening hand? Here are cards to mulligan for (in order):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Biotic Labor<\/li>\n<li>Astroscript Pilot Program<\/li>\n<li>Ice #1<\/li>\n<li>Anonymous Tip<\/li>\n<li>Econ #1<\/li>\n<li>Ice #2<\/li>\n<li>SanSan City Grid (moves up vs Gabe)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Your one and only objective is to get that Astrochain rollin'. If you have a Beale in HQ and don't suspect Siphon, leave it undefended. If that Beale is an Astroscript, protect it (I swear, the fact tihs deck exists angers the Gods of luck). Biotic Labor is the most sure-fire way to score your first Astroscript (and allows an alternate scoring method if your Astros get stolen), at only 5c if you use SfSS (which is also helpful against denial decks such as Reina or Gabe). I would not recommend switching SfSS for Subliminal Messaging or Restructure, as it greatly increasses your scoring window - something that I think has been undervalued.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that's right, no Jackson. Every time he showed in an opening hand, I was disappointed. I'll consider re-adding him if Noise gets the help he needs (never thought I'd be saying that). Data Raven is here because TWIY Scorch decks put the fear of God into runners, so they either never run that server again, find methods of bypassing it, or they run much more slowly and remove the tags. Very rarely have I encountered a runner willing to eat the tags without digging for a Plascrete first. I do however, intend to switch it for the spoiled Sentry ETR that can't be bypassed, and swapping Enigmas for Quandry.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck, if piloted properly without the worst possible draws, keeps the runner at phase two of the game (ice is out, but runner is still searching for breakers). My average game length is 8-11 turns, with about 10 cards left in R&amp;D.

{"identity":"images/JinRP.png","id":3946,"name":"Replicating Kills v1.0 (a  guide how to play RP properly)","creation":"2014-04-07 08:50:24","description":"<p>Hello everyone, this is the first Jinteki deck that I publish. A thing to know about me, is that I play <em>only<\/em> Jinteki, as a corp, ever since I started in September last year and yes... I guess that makes me \"that Jinteki player\" in your local playgroup. I have a lot of experience with the corp though, so let me share with you a deck I'm really excited about.<\/p>\n\n<h1>General Mindset<\/h1>\n\n<p>This deck wants to drain you from money, making you an easy target for Punitive Counterstrike (which I will refer to as PS from now on). In order to do this we have : <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>6 out of 9 agendas requiring you to spend money (and draw cards, cuz Neural EMP and PS pew-pew) <\/li>\n<li>Expensive to bypass Ice ( especially if Ninja is the dominant breaker in your playgroup rather than mimic) <\/li>\n<li>Economy that punishes passive runners but makes aggressive ones lose clicks\/time <\/li>\n<li>Caprice to make them \"re-run\" your already expensive server or to deny them a bit more gold and make them unable to steal your agenda bellow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note: You will do yourself a big favor, thinking that the runner will win the game with 3 agendas rather than 4, because you play 3 pointers. Better prepare yourself for that, rather than blaming it on \"luck\".<\/p>\n\n<h1>Agendas Spread<\/h1>\n\n<p>In the abstract above I've described in general the Agenda choice. However, there are a bit of space to play around. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You want the Fetal AI and the NAPD to drain them even more than the already taxing ICE. Fetal AI also makes them easier to finish off with PS or Neural EMP <\/li>\n<li>You want Priority Req, because it makes easier to ress the expensive ICE and allows you to really hammer them with PS. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Things to play around with :<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The current agenda pool is 21 points (rather than 20) and it's possible to change that. <\/li>\n<li>In the first version of this deck I had a single Clone retirement that I used for Archer rezzing, removing the bad pub from grim AND scoring from hand to finish 6 point games. It's a really valuable choice for this deck, the reason I don't play it is because with the new cards from \"Double Time\" it's possible to reinforce the money denial tactic. <\/li>\n<li>Take out a Priority Req and put in a Braintrust. It lowers the the chance for them hitting a 3 pointer + now they don't know if you put an unadvanced card if it's an upgrade, a Snare! or a braintrust!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>Economy<\/h1>\n\n<p>Plain and simple &ndash; expensive to trash and punishes passive runners <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I choose Private Contracts over PAD campaign in this deck, because it allows you to surge your money when you need it. You can take 6 money for 1 turn. PAD is possible to do the same, however you need to have 3 copies of it our and rezzed, rather than a single one (which is the case with Private Contracts). You want to be able to surge with money, so you can prepare your PS! <\/li>\n<li>Sundew is a monster. Especially in RP. If the runner doesn't address EVERY single one which you install, they will leave you swimming in money <\/li>\n<li>Subliminal is sick in RP. Arguable a deck that has 3 Snares, 3 Fetals and 3 Shocks and 3 Celebrity Gifts would like Subliminal more, however making them unable to run your remote on their last click really discourages them have to spend the one before that for fictive archives run. I might try Celebrity Gift in this deck at some point, but I'm happy with the economy atm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>ICE<\/h1>\n\n<p>Now here is where you might not agree with many of my choices, but let me go through them! <\/p>\n\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Low barrier numbers. Jinteki never had any good barriers to begin with. Generally unless u plan to spend 3 influence for a Heimdal 2.0 or get Bastions in, there isn't really a point to it. Corroder <em>is<\/em> the best breaker in game ( even among the different types) and they <em>will<\/em> have it. The reason I'm playing Himitso-Bako over a Bastion or a Paper Wall is because it allows me to move it around. I would generally use it to protect Sundews or\/and Private Contracts and I can move it around if I manage to trash their Corroders. I might wanna play 3 in this deck actually, but hard to take find a card slot. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Note: Why Wall of Thorns is a bad ICE.<\/h3>\n\n<p>I've seen people uploading \"winning\" decks with WoTx2 and I really find myself face palming. That ICE is just horrid. Let's take a closer look at it. First, it costs 4 or 5 to get through with Corrroder and it has a cost of 8. Which means it needs at least 2 runs through it, to pay off. That's not efficient, when Tollbooth costs 7 on a Gordian Blade for the same price (and they lose 3c regardless)! Second it has Net Damage and End the Run. The two subroutines are almost mutually exclusive. You either want them to take Net damage and kill them or to stop them in their feet and end the run. Doing both puts you nowhere. They either don't take the extra damage from the Agenda\/Trap\/Hokusai bellow or just continue to Agenda win for 4 credits ( to break the End the Run sub). Tsurugi gets around this problem very gracefully by - having a lower rezz cost, more net damage and allowing YOU to control the outcome. If you find yourself in a position to trash their Corroder it doesn't really matter if you have Himitsu-Bako or WoT. Conclusion - don't play Wall of Thorns!  <\/p>\n\n<h2>Sentries<\/h2>\n\n<p>Really expensive for Ninja. Neural Katana is 4 for 4. Tsurugi is 6 for 7 and Archer is 9\/10. Mimic is the worst thing that can happen to a Jinteki player, however that's why Archer and Grimm come in. IF you trash 1 of their mimics and discard the other via Net damage, it's suddenly another game :) <\/p>\n\n<h2>Code Gates<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viper for 1 Influence is great in RP deck (because it makes them lose a click) it fits well both on remote and as top ice on a central. Yagura is <em>amazing<\/em> and does some work that ICE ( that's the reason I don't wanna put the Quandary in) , especially in front of R&amp;D. <\/li>\n<li>Tollbooth &mdash; still one of the best ICE in game, it does kneel a bit for 5 against a Knight, but everything else makes through it slowly and expensive (which is the thing u want!) <\/li>\n<li>Chum + Data mine &mdash; it will catch people off-guard. The combo will allow you to kill people easily (especially if DM is out of your Meta atm) and the cards on their own work great in this deck. Chum boosting Grim for double Ninja pump or getting Tsurugi and Neural katana out of Mimic range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>The other cards<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Caprice Nisei , is just a <em>strong<\/em> card. It's not as game breaking as many people call it, because there is a chance in the game as it is (Hi there Maker's eye), but it will see play in pretty much every Jinteki deck from now on. It works great for this deck as well, because sometimes biding 2, knowing them that if they bid 2 they will be out of the money range to steal the agenda bellow &mdash; is <em>skill<\/em> , not luck! <\/li>\n<li>My initial deck didn't have Interns in it. However Caprice is a viable target to be sniped from R&amp;D so you will want her back <em>and<\/em> installing 3rd or 4th layer of ICE for free, is just great. <\/li>\n<li>Jackson x 2 ... You get around 3 \"free\" influence in this deck and Jack seems to be the best target, as pretty much the \"all mighty fixer\" making you draw into what u want and fixing overdrawing problems meanwhile. A good play is, leaving 5 points in archives (if they are at 0) preparing for a PS and Neural EMPs in your turn after knowing that it will kill them. If they score a 2 pointer or something changes your plan in the meantime (like a Plascrete) just Jackson them back in :) <\/li>\n<li>Ronin &mdash; maybe the most arguable card in this deck, but there is a reason for it. Maybe you are thinking \"Why not run a Junebug in always advance deck\" and you would be correct, if every good player didn't run at least 1 Infiltration or other expose in their decks. The card slots are so tight atm, that I don't have the space to put in 1-2 Zaibatsu Loyalties or Tricks of Light, to make the Junebug useful after it's exposed. Ronin on the other hand, even if it's exposed and lies protected in the remote behind 2-3 layers of ICE, they <em>have<\/em> to address it, because that 3 extra damage in a <strong>kill<\/strong> deck a good player can't leave. And all that for just 2 card slots!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE<\/strong>: I <em>want<\/em> Hokusai in this deck !! xD I want at least 2 Hokusai's in the deck, because they worked great in the previous version of the deck (let's call it the beta) comboing hard with Fetals and will go good with NAPD making them not trash the Grid when they enter :) However, I can't see to find slots because I want at least 15 ICE (previous version was with 17!) in RP ! An idea I'm having is to go to 54 cards for 22 points. That will result in 1 Clone retirement, 2x Hokusai and leave me with 2 slots for ICE. Don't know how consistent the deck will be though for drawing into Neural EMPs, PSs and Ronins. Will definitely try both and update for v2.0!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have reached this point in this \"article\", thank you!

It's current record is 12-1 (the only loss came from a friend playing it for the first time against me) and shows no sign of slowing down. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main advantage of this ID is that it provides no opportunity for the runner to slow down and regain control. The runner has to constantly maintain pressure lest he be outscored in 3-4 turns. This leads to runners making mistakes they wouldn't normally make. I usually win by scoring 6 points (it's alarmingly easy), but I have often won by kill too. Interestingly, if you notice, going for the kill is not the aim of this deck. Instead, damage is simply used to slow the runner down. But, funny things can happen like killing the runner with Yagura :P<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas:<\/p>\n\n<p>Braintrust - Simply a 3\/2 agenda that gets points. Sucks a little when these get stolen<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Breakthrough - This card is GOOD, like Astro good. Honestly, you kind of want the first one to get stolen. That brings down the next one to a 3\/2, and then you can fast track the other one for an easy 2\/2. One game, threw 2 of these and MHC down in open remotes. Runner hit 1 of them (just like I hoped), then on my turn, got a buck from MHC and scored the other. Next turn, scored the other from hand and we were at match point. That just feels good :)<\/p>\n\n<p>NAPD Contract - Everybody knows this agenda is awesome and in here is works great. Because of how much pressure the runner is under, they often have just enough money to get into a server. I have seen many NAPD\u2019s just stared at and put back down. <\/p>\n\n<p>Philotic Entanglement - God, kills me that this is only a 1 per deck! Again, another 3\/2 and it slows the runner down if they scored anything. While I prefer to score this if they have already stolen 1-2 agendas, but I\u2019ll score it right away if need. You are preferably scoring an agenda at least every 1-2 turns, 3 at the most.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson Howard - What can be said? He does whatever you need. Draw, archive saves, etc. He also works great as a bluff. I rarely end up keeping him on the board long, so I\u2019ll stick him in a protected server and let the runner run it thinking he\u2019s an agenda. This tactic works great in this deck. Everything starts to look like an agenda. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mental Health Clinic - This is a fun card. Again, I\u2019m not trying to flatline the runner, so the 1 plus card doesn\u2019t bother me. Instead the runner is faced with a problem: let me have 1 credit or spend 3 and not get an extra card\u2026. hmmm  :) I\u2019ll also use this as a bluff<\/p>\n\n<p>Snare! - Again, slow them down and make them fear you. It can kill, but usually not unless is gets pulled towards the end of the game when they get desperate and reckless. I sometimes use this as an agenda bluff, but only if the runner has proven that they will run everything that I lay down. Otherwise, keep it in hand for when Celebrity shows up. <\/p>\n\n<p>Upgrades:<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei - She is boss. Shoot, often I\u2019ll throw her down,immediately rezz and the runner ignores that server the rest of the game. Perfect\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>SanSan City Grid - Strictly speaking, you don\u2019t NEED this to win, but it sure helps. At the very least, you soak up 5 credits on the trash. Then you just Jackson it back in...<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations:<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity Gift - Not much to say. Makes money when you don\u2019t have a lot. <\/p>\n\n<p>Fast Track - This is pretty recent addition. I found that I was often digging for the last agenda I needed. Now I can just tutor it up into a hand of Snares and operations<\/p>\n\n<p>Hedge Fund - Yup<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Research Fundraiser - So, most people have been going back and forth on this card. I like it a lot, but only in the right situation. You have to be careful when you play. If the runner ended their turn with 0-3 credits, then DO NOT play this card. The better time to play this is when the runner is already flush with credits and getting 3 more won\u2019t make much difference. Typically anything over 10 and I\u2019ll play it if I need it. Again, another thing a lot of corps seem to forget is that you shouldn't be blowing through all your money cards as soon as they hit your hand. Hang onto them until you need them. They pad out your HQ and can surprise the runner. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:<\/p>\n\n<p>Wall of Static - Go get your Corroder buddy\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quandary - Go get your Yog<\/p>\n\n<p>Yagura - A great little piece of ice, best on R&amp;D of course<\/p>\n\n<p>Grim - Use this to trash whatever will slow down the runner the most. <\/p>\n\n<p>Guard - Perfect for remote servers and sneaking out an agenda. Also forces a sentry break to come out<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu - I didn't know what to think of this before, but I freaking love this ice! Sure, it dies to Parasite but no ice is perfect. No matter what, this ice puts a hardship on the runner. Pay 5 credits to get through with a full hand, or drop dangerously low to make it cheap. Interestingly, half the card is taxing, the other half sets up a kill. Very cool <\/p>\n\n<p>Pup - Taxing. Love it. Put it on R&amp;D<\/p>\n\n<p>Swordsman - This is my little surprise ice. If nobody is playing Atman or Knight or Crypsis or Overmind, then you don\u2019t need it. But I\u2019m going to hazard a guess and say that those are showing up a lot these days. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi - Taxing. Also, slim chance, but can setup a kill too. Great ice<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, still playing around with the exact composition of everything (thinking about how Mushin can fit into the deck and possibly Shi.Ky\u016b) but I\u2019m pretty stinking happy with how it is performing currently. Give it a spin and let me know how it goes!<\/p>\n","username":"omegalife2002","cards":{"01070":2,"01092":3,"01110":3,"01113":2,"02014":3,"04012":2,"04015":3,"04020":1,"04033":1,"04074":1,"04093":1,"04114":3,"04119":2,"04120":2,"05001":1,"05005":3,"05006":1,"05009":2,"05014":3,"05017":2,"05018":2,"05024":1,"05027":1}},

If you really hate NEH Astrobiotics, give this deck a shot!)<\/p>\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n<p>It was only early this year when I started to really get serious about Netrunner. A couple friends and I had decided to carpool around the Store Championship circuit in LA, pulled in by the allure of promo Kati Jones and Wotan playmats. I believe we ended up hitting up five tournaments: Hypno Comics in Ventura, Gameology in Montclair, Majestix CCG in Costa Mesa, Aero Hobbies in Santa Monica, and Brookhurst Hobbies in Garden Grove. It was a really fun experience that led to a lot of growth for me as a Netrunner player.<\/p>\n\n<p>Up to this point, I had heavily favored Anarchs and Shapers on the runner side. I had dismissed Criminals as boring - their style of \"win fast\" has always been very powerful, but it tends to lead to the same cookie-cutter decks. To make things worse, the Criminal cardpool probably has the highest power disparity of any faction. It's hard to make a creative yet competitive Criminal deck when a few elite, game-defining cards (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a>, etc.) are surrounded by an ocean of mediocrity. Perhaps for these reasons, I think that Criminals never quite caught on in LA as much as elsewhere; many of our competitive players also value originality very highly. But Honor &amp; Profit really broadened the cardpool and helped alleviate these issues. I think each of the H&amp;P runners has acquired a sizable following here.<\/p>\n\n<p>I no longer remember the corp deck I played at the first store championship, but as my runner I used a Whizzard <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>-<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> deck that I have been messing around with for a long time. It was a lot of fun, but unfortunately the deck was slow enough that my matches would frequently go to time. Even worse, the NBN fast advance decks that were rising to prominence were a pretty awful matchup. (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a> was a huge hassle for all of my numerous AI-based decks to deal with.) After a lackluster finish at Ventura, I finally decided that I was tired of handicapping my runner game. The World Is Yours* was both fast and consistent, and to beat it I had to match both. It was time to build my own <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/966226\/so-cal-regionals-1st-place-runner-deck\">Typical Solid Criminal Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Criminal deck I ended up with could probably be described as a Gabe control deck; instead of throwing all of its eggs into the SIphon basket like <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1008864\/deck\">most contemporary Criminal builds<\/a>, it could hold its own in a long game thanks to the duo of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02105\">Mr. Li<\/a>. That deck helped me win me the next Store Championship. One of my opponents told me that it was the best runner economic engine he had ever faced. My Criminal-innocence-bubble had been popped once and for all.<\/p>\n\n<p>(I have since learned to enjoy the Criminal playstyle. That's especially true now that corp decks are a real challenge to defeat; the constant danger of falling behind added much-needed zest to the Criminal game. The current competitive Shaper decks feel boring to me in comparison.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Flash forward half a year to October. The release of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06005\">Near-Earth Hub<\/a>, along with the widespread adoption of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, have turned NBN into a monster. I am struggling to find a runner deck that even can come close to competing with all of the top corp decks. I had tried the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06056\">Supplier<\/a> version of <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/profile\/2459\/Nordrunner\">Nordrunner<\/a>'s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MvDyvveCEog\">President\/CEO<\/a> and a personal version of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">PPVP<\/a> Kate, but disliked both. I had a Ken blitz deck with an excellent NEH matchup, but it usually ran out of steam against slower decks. I had an <a href=\"http:\/\/teamcovenant.com\/botounami\/2014\/05\/20\/anatomy-of-anarchy\/\">\"Anatomy of Anarchy\"<\/a> Quetzal build that was pretty good but probably could never beat Blue Sun, and a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02101\">Retrieval Run<\/a> Quetzal build that wasn't fast enough for NEH while <em>also<\/em> probably never beating Blue Sun.<\/p>\n\n<p>At last, it was time to revisit good old Gabe.<\/p>\n\n<p>My old controllish deck was no longer well-positioned in the new meta - NEH Astrobiotics is way too fast for you to fool around with shady guys like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02105\">Mr. Li<\/a>. Instead, I synthesized the deck with some new ideas. From the Ken deck I adopted <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05048\">Security Testing<\/a> for economy, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05046\">Passport<\/a> to get through <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a>, and some impactful singletons that I had liked. From AoA I borrowed the idea of using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> to ensure access for Siphon. After all that, I even had space for a few more meta choices!<\/p>\n\n<p>The result, I feel, was a fairly balanced deck that manages to have an excellent matchup against Near-Earth Hub.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Strategy<\/h2>\n\n<p>The most common question about any serious Gabe deck will probably be, \"Why not Andy?\" Honestly, the choice of identity largely comes down to personal preference. It's clearly possible to make an excellent and very similar Andy build with these cards. But I still think there are some strategic considerations that would lead me to pick Gabe over Andy. If I had to name a Netrunner strategy that will never be bad, I would say having lots of credits. A rich runner can steal NAPDs, trash assets, and generally get into servers when they <em>need<\/em> to get in. And as it turns out, Gabe is really great at getting rich.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gabe's identity power also puts immense pressure on HQ from turn 1. The corp has to protect HQ ASAP, and then Archives, and then continue to guard HQ with unrezzed ice to play around Account Siphon. That amount of ice costs lots of time and money to set up, which often leads to some number of easy R&amp;D accesses in the early game. That's a big advantage against NEH, where the game generally comes down to how many efficient accesses the runner can snatch from the centrals. If you draw it, an early <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> can decide the entire game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Gabe's increased efficiency at attacking HQ means that the corp's hand stays vulnerable throughout the entire game. Hence, he doesn't need HQ multi-access to compete against NEH in the same way that practically every other runner does - although <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> wouldn't be a terrible inclusion here either.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Card choices<\/h2>\n\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01029\">Bank Job<\/a> is making a huge comeback, because in the current meta it's a quick and enormously efficient economy card that will rarely backfire. Along with Security Testing, a Criminal player can turn any open remote server into their own economy engine. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02063\">Scrubber<\/a> is another very solid card right now. It especially shines against RP, where pretty much every card the corp plays is something that you have to trash. It's not quite as good against NEH, so I ended up dropping down to one copy to fit in the third Bank Job.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>No <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapaces<\/a> because I really dislike pure hate cards. When runners were dominant, it made much more sense to hedge one's bets by playing Plascrete. But in the current environment, any dead card against Astrobiotics is too much of a liability, especially in a deck with very few draw effects. Feel free to add Plascretes as your meta dictates, but I prefer to take some risks and play around Scorched Earth when necessary.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Three each of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02043\">Emergency Shutdown<\/a>. Here are the Blue Sun hate cards. A well-timed Shutdown can really set Blue Sun back, while Inside Job lets you jump over a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04078\">Curtain Wall<\/a> to land a Shutdown or steal an agenda. Conveniently, they both happen to be excellent cards in their own right and are far from useless in other matchups. But I happened to dodge all of the other Blue Sun players at Worlds, so I still don't understand this matchup very well. It's possible that these cards aren't impactful enough, and that the slots could be better spent on other cards.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> is the component of the deck that I remain least certain about. It is annoying to play before Desperado or after other programs, and it becomes unplayable once most of your breaker suite is assembled. Still, a backup AI breaker has a ton of synergy with the Criminal playstyle, and Overmind seems like the best AI breaker available right now. (Sadly, I think <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> has become too slow for the current meta.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02006\">Peacock<\/a> is the decoder we need, not the decoder we deserve. I think every deck wants some way of getting past Lotus Field on a remote - a <em>very<\/em> common corp play after the runner has played or discarded a Passport - and Peacock is not much less efficient than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02007\">ZU.13 Key Master<\/a> for practically every code gate seeing play right now. As long as you have enough cash, Peacock lets you get in when you have to, and that meshes very well with Gabe's playstyle.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The deck is rounded out with some out-of-faction 1-ofs that aren't strictly necessary for the deck to function, but are still always nice to draw. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> is an MVP at getting past <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/02110\">Eli<\/a> or high-strength sentries efficiently. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> destroys whatever the most troublesome ice is at the moment, and is especially handy against Replicating Perfection. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a> is a nice singleton because it is awkward to draw in multiples, whereas the first copy is pretty much always great to draw.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If I somehow managed to free up 2 influence, the first card I would look at adding is the 2nd <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a>. Having access to R&amp;D multi-access is very important, and the deck is a little light on that front right now.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>Playing tips<\/h2>\n\n<ul><li><p>If you've never seen it before, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/966226\/so-cal-regionals-1st-place-runner-deck\">my all-time favorite Netrunner strategy article<\/a>. Although the individual card choices may be a little outdated now, jopejope still provided a timeless explanation of the nuances to playing any aggressive runner.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Against NEH, I tend to trash rezzed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PADs<\/a> but leave <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a> around for Bank Jobs. Always trash <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan<\/a> if the corp will have enough money on their turn to threaten scoring with it. It's often possible to get an extra R&amp;D access by threatening to trash <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson<\/a>. Try to play <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01011\">Mimic<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> before encountering unrezzed ice, and don't run on unrezzed ice on your last click if you don't have a killer (or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06061\">Architect<\/a> will absolutely ruin your day).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The RP matchup is a drawn-out attrition war, further complicated in a tournament environment by the fact that you'll have to play really quickly. Keep their economy down for as long as possible by trashing assets and using Emergency Shutdown. Hope for good early accesses. When the centrals become unprofitable, find Kati Jones and pile up credits. \"Take 3, put 3 on Kati\" is a turn that you might have to get used to. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03052\">Dirty Laundry<\/a> could be a good addition to help fight <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/06022\">Enhanced Login Protocol<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Against Blue Sun, you'll have to acquire a good sense for when you can pressure safely and when running will likely get you killed. Hope to snag some agenda points while you can still run. Try to have Shutdown ready when they make an <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a> play. Kati Jones will once again be crucial for winning a credit war in the long game.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Unfortunately, the PE shell game matchup is something of a crapshoot. Luck and player skill are the most important factors here, so if you're facing a skilled PE player you're probably in a heap of trouble. Learn to play carefully while still taking calculated risks. Account Siphon is a key card because Jinteki lacks fangs while broke. Identify which other cards are important to play out and which cards should be held back as net damage fodder - remember that you don't need too many credits against this deck.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>Summary<\/h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps more than most Netrunner decks, this deck is a product of its time. In a few months, I have serious doubts that this particular configuration would still be well-positioned. But, as I said above, being rich will never be a bad strategy, so I believe that the Consummate Professional will always be a reasonable choice. His unparalleled ability to punish bad draws is especially powerful right now while the corp is advantaged. That's because a well-constructed Gabe deck should always be able to get some number of wins by capitalizing on an early stumble from the corp. Andromeda, on the other hand, becomes comparatively better while the runner is favored, because her higher consistency reduces the number of losses from sheer bad luck.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's why now is a great time for the non-Andy Criminals to shine. Make the NEH players realize that they are far from invincible. See to it that <em>your<\/em> name is written on the moon.<\/p>\n","username":"tmoiynmwg","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":3,"01050":3,"02006":1,"02043":3,"02063":1,"02087":1,"02091":2,"02104":2,"02106":1,"02107":1,"03054":1,"05046":1,"05048":3,"05053":2}},
{"identity":"images/Nasir.png","id":10162,"name":"No Sleep Natman (Atman Nasir primer \/ guide)","creation":"2014-10-25 11:36:15","description":"<p>This deck is the result of a lot of testing with the Nasir Atman concept, after multiple tweaks to adapt it to the current meta via a bunch of tutorable silver bullets. The deck thrives on efficiency, and uses a \"just in time\" approach, with special emphasis on not wasting a single credit. It is super fun and hard to pilot! I'm planning to take it to Spanish tournaments and report on it. So far it deals surprisingly well with most major archetypes, including NEH Astrobiotics. I've really fallen in love with this deck and I'm doing my best to be a pioneer in taking Atman Nasir to a competitive level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your game plan is to set up powerful hardware pieces and sources of recurring credits, and maintaining constant, fearless pressure while staying prepared to respond to any ice. Your credit level will stay close to 0, with some small spikes when running against certain archetypes (will go into that in the matchup section). Don't worry, your Atmans and Parasites will allow you to run broke. I've ran against a 4 ice deep deep Blue Sun server with Curtain, Hadrian's and two Elis with 0 starting credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the guide to pilot this deck. <strong>Disclaimer: The guide is huge! Feel free to skip to parts that interest you :).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Economy: Where are your Sure Gambles?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Nasir is probably the most unorthodox runner when it comes to econ, and this particular list goes one step further. You won't see any traditional economy here. However, well piloted, this deck generates ridiculous amounts of money. I've seen many people dismiss lists like these outright because they lack any of the \"normal\" economy pieces, but believe me, they are not needed. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The main piece is <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02049\">personal workshop<\/a>. You really, really want this card out; keep any hand with PW on it, and mulligan if you don't have PW, <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01034\">Diesel<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03046\">SMC<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02088\">replicator<\/a> (I will go into why these are important opening cards later).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/06058\">Order of Sol<\/a> is another major player in Nasir's economy. Remember all those people that said it sucks? Don't listen to them! This card is completely fantastic. In case you haven't seen it in action yet, remember that it procs on both your turn and the Corp's turn, which means you can use it to pump money into Personal Workshop at an astounding 2 credits per turn rate. It also pays off the turn it comes out, so it essentially costs 1 credit. Learning to adapt OOS to Nasir's ID ability is a very important skill to develop. Remember that OOS let's you \"carry over\" a single credit when you hit a just rezzed piece of ice.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a>: Stimhack is both an economy card and a surprise attack. It is a table-turning ambush that you should keep in your hand until the best opportunity arises, so I will go into its uses later. However, it can buy you those two RD interfaces on the workshop in a pinch, so it's good to count it as Economy too (and a damn fine card for that matter).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Recurring credits: <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01005\">Cyberfeeder<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01041\">Toolbox<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/06038\">Net Celebrity<\/a>. These aren't strictly speaking economy (with the exception of NC, maybe), but they're worth mentioning. Remember that Feeders and Toolboxes allow you to pump Atman when it hits the table, which can be very useful. Also, count Cyberfeeder when considering your options from cracking SMC, since it will pay for parasites, nerve agent and datasuckers.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Facechecking 101: How to exploit Corp ice without blowing yourself up<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Do you like facechecking Jinteki turn 1? You are going to enjoy this deck. Fearless facechecking is not only possible but pretty safe too, as long as you follow some basic precautions.<\/p>\n\n<p>The primary tool for facechecking is, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03046\">Self-Modifying Code<\/a>, together with the knowledge that your deck runs <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02066\">Deus Ex<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04067\">Sharpshooter<\/a>. Don't be fooled by its flowery look, SMC is nothing but a shield, a glowing piece of anti-ice armor. Turn 1 SMC -> Run is a fantastic play even against the gnarliest Jinteki decks (even though I'd wait to have the Net Shield against PE in particular). If you get a really beefy piece of ice rezzed, you can crack the SMC pre-encounter and fetch Deus Ex, then break the ice and get out with the access and the money. If the ice isn't that big or dangerous, you can use the pre-encounter money to get yourself a 0 counter Atman, which is always necessary, and bounce. Even if you run with 0 credits, almost every single ice in the game will give you enough cash on-encounter to fetch either Deus or Shooter, and the few inconvenient exceptions will not kill you outright.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is very tempting to use SMC to do cool Parasite tricks and to find matchup specific silver bullets, but I'd advise to keep one copy out there at all times (or have it accessible through clone chip) to save your bacon in case you hit an inopportune Ichi \/ Shinobi \/ Grim, etc. Seeing a big ice rezzed should be a source of pleasure, never an \"oh shit\" moment, and SMC is key to that.<\/p>\n\n<p>So far we've talked about dealing with the ice itself, however, accesses are another story and you should be aware of the dangers you can face there too. Be prepared to deal with Snare in the decks in which it makes sense. Always run with 3 spare credits against upgraded servers if you expect Ash. If running against PE, there is another set of precautions that I will explain in the matchup section that make it reasonably safe to multiaccess R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Personal Workshop and you: A course in Lean Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Personal Workshop is the soul of this deck. I don't have to tell you how good it is, but I would like to go into some of its more obscure uses. Did you know that PW can be your second Plascrete Carapace? Did you know that you can use PW vertically or horizontally? How would you protect your PW from sudden tags?<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the main benefit of PW is that it allows you to pay for cards mid-run. This allows you to empty your wallet before hitting an Ice, and to spend recurring credits from Net Celebrity and Stimhack on expensive hardware and programs. Also, it generates econ on its own by essentially giving you 1 credit at the start of each turn, and finally it has a great synergy with Order of Sol by allowing you to go down to 0 on the Corp turn consistently.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knowing all this, the straightforward way to use PW is to load it with an expensive enough program or piece of hardware that will soak enough money until your next turn. Playing like this is fine, but sometimes you might want to use the workshop a bit differently, by having multiple things at 1 credit, ready to go at any moment. This \"horizontal play\" is very helpful in some scenarios, and I personally like to set it up that way, specially against some archetypes. Here are some reasons why:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Programs in PW don't take up MU. This means you can store any silver bullets and have them ready to go at any moment without hurting your current board state. Storing Atmans delays the choice of counters, which is always good. Parasites at 1 can be dropped at the end of the Corp's turn, which makes them much meaner, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Hardware in PW which isn't immediately necessary is best kept there in case you draw into a Replicator. <\/li>\n<li>Following the last point: With a Replicator on board or on PW, the Personal Workshop can be used as a makeshift carapace, if you're playing horizontally. Whenever you get sea-source'd or you expect incoming damage, grab the first paid ability window and drop all the hardware at once. This will flood your hand with replicated pieces and protect you from the kill (make sure to end the turn with enough money to do this when playing against Weyland, you want to protect both yourself and your PW from trashing).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you choose to play your PW horizontally, please be careful about tags. You should keep enough money to quickly evacuate all the important cards from the PW in response to a Sea Source or Breaking News, so all your eggs aren't caught in the same basket. Don't worry about Elizabeth Mills, due to the timing structure of the Corp's turn, even if they rez it you still have an ability window to evacuate the PW before it's nuked from orbit. The only way you can get caught with your pants off is by ending the turn completely broke.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some words on Replicator that don't really deserve their own section: Replicator is a great card to have, on PW or on the board, and as early as possible. It might not look like it but Replicator is a draw engine. Conditional, yes, but extremely powerful. Almost all of your hardware stacks (with the exception of Toolbox) so you will want to be drawing those multiples and thinning your deck. Try to keep hardware that you don't need \"just yet\" (like Clone Chips) in the PW until you get that Replicator on the table.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Early game: Kickstarting the Engine<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Your approach to the early game will depend on multiple factors, including your hand (duh) and your enemy corp. You want to run early, but to do so you need to make sure of two things:\n1.  You will be able to empty your money somehow before hitting ice in an efficient manner.\n2.  You won't take excessive damage or lose programs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Against decks that don't typically go for damage I may feel comfortable doing R&amp;D interface - Datasucker - Run R&amp;D - Draw, but of course I wouldn't ever do that against jinteki. SMC-Run is a good play in almost every single scenario, so you shouldn't be afraid to do that. Even R&amp;D interface - SMC - Run works well. I must insist about being careful with damage. Early Nasir suffers a lot from losing cards; its engine is made of multiple pieces with little redundancy, and you can't use Clone Chips willy-nilly to pay for mistakes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if your starting hand includes Personal Workshop, you want it out ASAP to be efficient from the get go. Similarly, Order of Sol should hit the table the first time you are at 2 credits. Playing these key pieces of drip econ early on does a lot for your late game power. <\/p>\n\n<p>If you are playing against NEARPAD, RP or other asset econ decks, you may want to make an exception from the \"SMC is a shield\" rule and fetch Paricia as early as possible. It will pay off, believe me. Just don't crack SMC for a Datasucker. Suckers are very important indeed but they will come at their own time and don't deserve wasting a SMC, at least not this early.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remember: Corp ice is your econ. Don't fear hitting big ice (your SMC will save you), and don't be too concerned with small ice either (if you've played the way I said, Pop-up windows and quandaries will just be a minor annoyance). Keep constant pressure on the corp, build your engine through their own money and you will proceed into an advantageous mid game.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Mid game: Staying Strong<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>At this point you should have at least some of the pieces of the Nasir engine. It isn't always possible to draw these Workshops, but with creative SMC and Clone Chip uses, it's possible to exploit ice efficiently anyway. While you fish for the remaining parts of the holy trifecta (PW, OOS, Replicator), you probably found time to set up an atman at 0 (which you almost always want) and a couple suckers. This is when Corp economy is at its best relative to you and they will try to execute their plan.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to your accesses and knowledge of the meta, you should have a general idea of what that plan is. Here's how you respond to some of the most typical strategies:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Glacier decks that look for scoring windows: You will do well against those. Here's where Stimhack comes to life. Keep close to broke at all times, and watch as they IAA in a remote they don't expect you to break in a million years. That's your moment to run blind on the front ice (to get money), bounce off it, and then re-enter with stimhack, summoning atmans, parasites and whatnot. Just beware of traps, but the surprise factor of Stimhack makes it hard for people to justify IAA on a Junebug when you're broke. If they do drip econ, don't drop your Paricia pressure.<\/li>\n<li>Meat damage flatline decks: Your main problem against those is that there's no way in the world you're going to avoid getting Sea Source'd. If by the mid-game you haven't got your Plascrete yet, don't run, and focus on improving your board state. Remember you can put together a \"makeshift plascrete\" thanks to replicator and ready-to-go hardware in the PW. Many Weyland players don't think of this and will waste their sea sources, so exploit that. Even if you have OOS on the table, start ending your turns with enough money to protect your Personal Workshop.<\/li>\n<li>Fast Advance: Multiaccess the hell out of these. SMC a nerve agent, replicate R&amp;D interfaces, and keep them on R&amp;D lock. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Late game: Recurring Efficiency<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>By now, it's unlikely you will depend on Ice for your economy anymore. You should have a significant rig, preferably with Toolbox out and a good distribution of Atmans (I like 0-2-4 or 0-4-6 depending on the deck), with at the very least one Datasucker. These should be backed up by at least 4 sources of recurring credits (2 Cyberfeeders and a toolbox, for example), and you should be protected against whatever means the Corp wants to flatline you (plascrete, net shield, an accessible Deus Ex).<\/p>\n\n<p>You have a good late game, because a well developed Nasir is hard to stop. Here's where you will be thankful for making intelligent use of these clone chips, because they will help fixing any gaps on your board (accidents happen). Keep constant pressure, remember to stay protected, and go for these last points!<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Silver Bullets: Hunting the Corporate Werewolves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The deck runs a suite of five silver bullets to deal with some of the most relevant archetypes, and of course these five slots should remain meta-specific. If you think one of these cards is dead in your environment feel free to change it to a third Replicator, Net Celebrity or Order of Sol, which are always helpful, or to include a different piece.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03048\">Inti<\/a>: It's here mostly to deal with Wraparound, and will remain as long as NEH stays relevant. It also works well against what I believe will be good archetypes soon (Grail ice suites, NEXT ice), and deals with unadvanced Ice Walls. While not the most efficient, its strength pumping ability combines well with Nasir, since you can choose to dump pre-encounter credits on it. In any case, datasuckers can help bridge the gap. It will be invaluable against Grail suites in the future, because it completes the trifecta Inti - Sharpshooter - Deus X against Galahad - Lancelot - Merlin, preventing all of their cross-effects.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02066\">Deus X<\/a>: Not sure if I should call it a silver bullet, because it's pretty much central to the strategy. Its presence in the deck almost justifies early aggression. it can also help you when you absolutely need to hit Jinteki advanced remotes. Remember that you can break Heimdall II with this, it's easy to forget!<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/04067\">Sharpshooter<\/a>: Ditto to Deus X. It protects against a different set of calamities.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/01045\">Net Shield<\/a>: Makes all flavors of Jinteki (PE in particular) a breeze to deal with. Super comfortable to have.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03045\">Paricia<\/a>: Direct counter to drip econ. Yes, it isn't as good as Scrubber, but it's in faction and tutorable. It won't help you kill SanSans, but will deal with PAD campaigns, Adonis, Eves, Sundews and Mental health Clinics beautifully. Worth tutoring early if you think you will get mileage out of it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Matchup Guide: Tools for each Job<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Jinteki RP Glacier<\/strong>: This is a matchup in which you really benefit from getting two SMC's early. One for Paricia, and another to search for Deus X if necessary. You want to fight their drip econ with all your might, while trying to make the mandatory central run of the turn profitable. Even if you don't manage to get Paricia, still do your best to get rid of Sundews and MHC's. Remember to run with 3 credits against servers with upgrades; nothing sucks more than hitting an Ash and being unable to trash it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to stay ahead economically and you will outpace them, since your rig isn't easy to tax in the late game.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Jinteki PE net damage<\/strong>: At the beginning of this match you will make an unusual, yet important request: Ask your opponent to warn you after placing the second advancement token on a card, and before the third, so you can use paid abilities. This is important as many PE decks run Chronos Project and you will want to fish Deus Ex from the Heap before they get rid of it for good.<\/p>\n\n<p>Feel free to run early to exploit ice, but keep access (and specially multi-access) low until you have your Net Shield out (which should be a big priority). Running against PE with Net Shield and the possibility of getting a Deus Ex will make your life much simpler. Beating PE is like eating a hedgehog with your hands tied behind your back, so take as many precautions as possible. Here are some of the main ones:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't run last click (duh). If you run third click, have 2 credits left for tag removal.<\/li>\n<li>If you access ANYTHING, have at least 2 credits to pay for potential Fetals. If you're multi accessing, you should have 4 if possible.<\/li>\n<li>End your turns with 1 credit to pay Net Shield for Neural EMPs and agenda scores. These add up a great deal.<\/li>\n<li>Don't touch remotes unless you get PE broke somehow. If you do, go ham on them for a turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>NEH astrobiotics<\/strong>: You will aim for multiaccess as the game progresses, preferably R&amp;D lock (although if you get the chance to drop a Nerve Agent it wouldn't hurt either). This matchup would benefit greatly from splashing Imp but the influence was very tight, so you'll have to do with what you have. <\/p>\n\n<p>A major advantage against NEH is that its ice is low strength and has little stopping power, with the exception of Tollbooth and Eli. Tollbooth amounts to a huge credit swing in your favor the first time you meet it, and you should be looking forward to parasite bomb it ASAP: it's worth it. You should carefully engineer your rig so you can mantain the lock into late game. It is unavoidable for the eventual Fast Track and\/or NAPD contract sneaking through, and that's why Nerve Agent is a good tool for this match.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Supermodernism and variants<\/strong>: Plascrete soon, and preferably set up a horizontal Personal Workshop with Replicator, in case you need to flood your hand in a pinch. Keep money around to evacuate your PW and prevent the all-eggs-one-basket scenario. Remember that Archer can't be tackled with a SMC and on-encounter credits alone, so be careful with that. Keep pressure equally on all servers to slow down their economy, and remember that Snare is a thing (Deus X on the table won't hurt). The new Blue Sun variants of Supermodernism are even easier to deal with, because Nasir counters Blue Sun's ID ability very well. You will be making lots of money at their expense, specially if they decide to rez a Curtain Wall on your face.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>More matchups incoming as I get more experience with the deck :).<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Dropped Cards: Those that got cut and Why<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Here is a list of cards that were tested and got eventually cut from the final list, together with the reason why, as they're often seen in Nasir lists and I want to justify to the best of my ability why they didn't make it.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/06079\">Astrolabe<\/a>: Aside from the lore\/theme connection, I don't really see how Astrolabe benefits Nasir. It's a very matchup dependant card, and it will be dead against a good number of decks. In a list with 3xTrade In I would consider a singleton, but it doesn't make the cut in such a tight deck.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02085\">HQ Interface<\/a>: I played with three of those for a long time, but 6 influence is very hard to justify. 1x Nerve Agent grants us the (tutorable) ability to do the same thing, while maintaining synergy with Cyberfeeder.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/06078\">Trade-in<\/a>: In very few occasions you want to sacrifice a piece of hardware (Replicator and Toolbox are the only two that might be considered for sacrifice, but that comes with its own set of problems) and even if you did, there isn't anything specific to tutor, aside from the rare shy plascrete. Not worth the slots.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03051\">Ice Analyzer<\/a>: Another card that is often synonymous with Nasir, which I dislike. I generally want my programs to go through Personal Workshop so I can delay my choices, and IA doesn't work with that. I don't think it's worth it for SMC searches alone, but your mileage may vary.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/03039\">Omni-drive<\/a>: Many people swear by this card and I can see why. I've tested it, and it's quite good on paper, but it needs to hit the board before Atman does which makes it inconvenient very often. Cyberfeeder does the same job sans MU increase, helps you pay for viruses, and can enter the board after Atman and still be useful.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a>: Pretty good, an I'm occasionally tempted to re-include it, but ultimately it's a bit too expensive. Diesel fits Nasir better.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/card\/02003\">Imp<\/a>: It pains me greatly not to have a slot for this card. It would be a fantastic silver bullet, and in a meta SWAMPED with Jinteki PE and NEH Astrobiotics I might drop something like 1x Parasite 1x Stimhack to include an Imp and a replicator. Unfortunately 3 influence is a lot for the \"general purpose\" version of this list.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, all forms of traditional econ (including Kati Jones): Seriously, they're not needed :). Kati Jones might be the closest to an include, but I think it's unnecessary. She's essentially a telegraphed Stimhack that saves you the brain damage, but needs to be installed, protected, and clicked four consecutive turns. It slows your game plan in matchups in which you need to be fast, and it's redundant in slow games due to all of your drip econ. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Thanks for reading<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Hope this wall of text was useful for someone!

The meta then included Criminal reigning supreme, and Yog and Datasucker being in every deck (or Atman\/Datasucker).<\/p>\n\n<p>Skip ahead to August of this year. Will o' the Wisp and Taurus are released. In light of the Posted Bounty and Biotic Labor featured in my decklist, I cannot resist the play-making potential of these two cards. Lucky Find in Katman is now a staple and my deck is having trouble competing economically with it; Power Shutdown is only effective sometimes, depending on the timing of runner installs, because of Pre-Paid Voicepad being an early-play staple to their mid-game pressure. Will o' The Wisp seems a perfect way to deal with a Shaper that simply can't be kept out, while holding an unrezzed Swordsman on R&amp;D until rezzing it to trash the 4-strength Atman will buy me the score window I need. Decklist seen <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/8617\/keystone-v1-3\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is very effective, but the rise of NEH means runners learn to play faster, and to be able to punish a runner who moves quickly, I simply need more splash. Too often a Decoy or NACH hits the table, and I stare at the SEA\/Scorch\/Scorch\/Biotic in my hand and shrug; Now I have to Biotic score a Posted Bounty, forfeit it to blow the Decoy, then still have the money to SEA\/Scorch\/Scorch next turn, and this is assuming no Plascretes (But you're Weyland, so there'll be Plascretes). I need the ability to take my deck in whatever direction I need to, at any time; The Scorch play is too difficult to threaten without crossing the event horizon into Flatline Committal territory, where you lose potential scoring windows hoping for them to run carelessly, and instead they Plascrete, they take 8, they clear Kati, they Index you, and there's your chance. I need 15 influence, I need more power cards, and most of all I need the ability to get money quickly to not fall behind and stay behind after rezzing a Grim force a Faerie to pop just to save time. <\/p>\n\n<p>The deck becomes so difficult to pilot that I actually switch to PE for a couple tournaments, just for the heck of trying something new; Something silly that runs 8 ice, Tori Hanzo, House of Knives, Cerebral Casts, Scorches, and Neurals. I take second because a lot of Andromeda \"run all the time\" decks show up and they get careless, but I just didn't enjoy myself that much. I miss laying a Weyland identity on the table, and the very idea of green cards forcing the runner to respect me. I miss the power. I miss the punishment cards. DO NOT STEAL FROM ME. Power Shutdown for 0, trash the Faerie. Install the Atlas. Advance. Score it out next turn. Now I have a Scorch on demand. R&amp;D has an Enigma on it. Help yourself. See what happens. I LOVE this style of play. Building towering servers of ice is slow, and someone like me with ADD needs more action. NBN is un-interactive; and RP, once again, is just so damn slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then Blue Sun is released. For someone who has only played Weyland, since Creation and Control was released, wow, this solved so many problems Weyland has had up to this point:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Weak late game<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Dependency on combo cards<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Enigma and Quandary are your only code gate options without using influence<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>High-economy runners mean if you don't get to match point in time, you'll never be able to Scorch them; at match point Punitive is ineffective.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Rush deck ice is cheap and binary, a rough thing to pilot in a meta where Parasite is everywhere<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Faerie and Sharpshooter always hit the table in the first few turns, neutering any possibility of Archer making plays for you without a Corporate Troubleshooter; Dumping your credits into a CT often means a runner with a good economy will overtake you if you are not using your CT at match point<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Weyland economy depends on scoring agendas; Hostile Takeover and Geothermal Fracking (although everyone has convinced themselves they would rather have a leg amputated than take more than 1 Bad Pub), and to a lesser extent, Government Contracts. Govt Contracts is a fantastic agenda, but nearly impossible to score (in my southwest Ohio meta, there is an inside joke with my deck about Government Contracts; it's there for you to take so that I can score the 'good' agendas), and if you do score it, it's usually pulling out all your tricks to do so (rezzing the Archer, pumping a CT, or just them letting you have it and then Indexing you for 4 points or Siphoning you to disarm the CT and then running it anyway), and leaving yourself high and dry for several turns while you use it's ability of \"spend most of your turn to get a Hedge Fund\". If you're in a position where you can spend 2 clicks for 4 credits, the runner has already lost, and you should have just scored an over-advanced Atlas to search for 2 Hostile Takeovers\/1 HT and another Atlas to just close the game out.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Most of all: Blue Sun allows you to rez 'utility' ice, i.e. ice that is perhaps not binary but serves a strong purpose in advancing your board state, without having to actually SPEND that money. Ice that has a great effect, but once you rez it, fires once, and that's the end of it. No more surprise, barely taxing, or you're too low on credits and you just opt to not rez it at all, because if you do, you can't rez the Enigma or Archer behind it without being at 3 credits (a number Weyland NEVER wants to be at all game!) and getting exploited on some other server.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>I have been following Blue Sun closely in forums, seeing what people are trying to do with it, but for the most part, they're just trying to copy other glacier decks, insistent on parroting the \"taxing decks are winning decks\" mantra that started with Red Coats and now dominates in RP and NEH; Hadrian's, Curtain Walls, Wotans, Heimdalls, whatever, with things like Eliza's Toybox or Adonis Campaign to bounce so every turn you gain credits. I was thrilled at the idea, though, of applying my Keystone skeleton to an identity that would literally solve EVERY problem with it in its 10-influence GRNDL version.<\/p>\n\n<p>This was meant to be a \"these are all the cards I think will be effective\" proof of concept deck, but it worked MUCH better than I anticipated it would. Resilient to Parasite and Knight. Swordsman no longer needed because Datasucker is easily trashed with Power Shutdown, and if you want to play a 10\/14-str Atman, go ahead. A lot of cards present in this decklist are present in many Blue Sun decklists: Hadrian's and Curtain Walls and Oversight AI especially. But here are the MVPs of the deck, with some explanation:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p><strong>Reversed Accounts<\/strong>: WOW. This card is completely bananas. 1 Influence? Yes please. Worried about whether or not they can break your remote? You have Archer there with (ideally) a Hadrian's in front (so when Corroder is trashed Inside Job must be used) and Enigma so they need all 3 breakers, they have a Faerie and a Clone Chip out with a Gordian Blade and Corroder. Hadrian's is 7 to break, Enigma 2 (conservatively 1 if running on last click), and Archer 4 and a trashing of their Faerie. 12 - 13 Credits, but with that Clone Chip you can't even bluff\/waste a Posted Bounty to create a score window because they can get the Faerie back. Instead, drop this in to create a scoring window. Install Advance Advance. Do they run it? Rez the Ice, make them burn their credits, on your turn bounce the Hadrian's to your hand if you must, and drop that Atlas. Do they not run it? Advance first click, rez, use it's ability 2nd click. They just lost 12 credits, the amount they need to get through your server. 3rd click, install the agenda. Score it out next turn. This is the trap Weyland has been waiting for, not Shattered Remains. Reversed Accounts.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Midseason Replacements<\/strong>: To hell with your tag avoidance. Steal from me? I have 30 credits. I don't have a problem dumping 15 into a Midseason on you. Spend all your credits to stop me. Or don't... You have 2 Plascretes right? What is Weyland gonna do to you? Close your Accounts? They have so much money, who cares. I'd rather let them waste 15 credits and try to win before they do. But if you're tagged, goodbye Supplier. Goodbye, Kati. Goodbye, Professional Contacts. Strangely, Compromised Employee is ABSOLUTELY worth trashing if they're tagged. You bounce and rez ice so often that with 2 or 3 of those out, the runner doesn't <em>need<\/em> economy. <em>You<\/em> are their economy. So 15 tags, so what? Here's what: They enter tag-me mode. They will keep 4 cards in hand. They have to click to draw or play burst draw cards now, and can't go all-in (unless at match point, which is, granted, not ideal for you to be playing Midseason at). A runner plays 2 Plascretes for the most part, and even while tagged, just keeps a hand of 4 unless they happen to even HAVE a 3rd Plascrete in their deck, let alone draw it. Why does this matter? That brings me to the next card.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Information Overload<\/strong>: Let's talk about 'taxing ice'. I can basically always Midseason you, even if it means having to bounce back a Curtain Wall I OAI'ed earlier. When I rez a piece of ice that says <em>Pay 15 credits or lose 15 installed cards<\/em>, what will you do? It only has to work once. My turn comes back around. Blue Sun it back. Get your 6 credits back. The runner has been punished for taking tags that they can't stop you from giving. Now shuffle the cards in HQ. Install a piece of ice where you think they will run next turn, if they were to run. Install a 2nd piece of ice on your remote. Install an agenda in that remote. Pass turn. Ok, Andy, where is the Information Overload? Make sure you run with enough credits to break the subroutines on the IO, or lose those Plascretes. I'm Weyland and I'm playing Midseason, you know I have Scorches. It's your call.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Taurus<\/strong>: Another great one-of, though I'm considering going to 2-of; It's 5 to rez, 3 to pump and force the trashing of 1 hardware <em>regardless<\/em> of if they match the trace or not. Then bounce it back, get 5 credits back. Shuffle your HQ, install a piece of ice back where Taurus was, and another piece of ice where you think they'll run. Where is the Taurus? Like I said, this deck absolutely does not fear Datasucker. That removes Mimic from the equation. The common sentry breakers to be aware of will be Femme and Faerie, (and possibly Dagger\/Switchblade depending on how the meta evolves from here) and both are things you <em>want<\/em> the runner to play. Waste a Faerie on a Taurus, that's 1 less Faerie for Archer or Grim. Femme'ing ice is nearly impossible to do versus this deck, because I will just bounce what you Femme. Hard-breaking a Taurus with Femme is 7 credits, that's fine too. The runner doesn't want to play Femme when you are bouncing sentries back to your hand, shuffling, and dropping 2 ice. They have to face-check it to know what to Femme, and the only pieces in this deck they would Femme (outside of Archer) get bounced after they're rezzed, so what they essentially have in their deck is an extremely cost-inefficient 9-cost Sentry breaker. Spend 9 Credits when it costs 10 - 12 to break in to this remote. Guess what's going to happen if you steal from me when we're running a 20-credit disparity? Taurus trashes Desperado early, reliably, which puts the choke on Security Testing Andy; It trashes Clone Chips reliably or forces the Shaper to SMC for a sentry breaker when they don't want to. It trashes the belligerent turn 1 runner Plascrete, if you have the extra 3 credits to spare. At any point in the game, it is a great 1-of. Or better yet, don't rez it, let them run in with the SMC out. My turn? Power Shutdown for 0. 1 Credit to remove your ability to tutor a breaker to save you during your next run. You might see my top card and know I just drew an Archer; I'm Weyland, of Course I have an Archer. Now go draw for a card to deal with it because I just installed 2 ice and 1 of them is an Archer. Or is it? Play a Faerie and run, because it's an Ice Wall and an Enigma. My turn? Power Shutdown for 0. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Jackson Howard<\/strong>: One of the MVPs of the deck, and not just because Jackson has been a fantastic card for 95% of all corp decks for almost a year and going. Here is a small list of what Jackson lets you do:<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>-Power Shutdown safely<\/p>\n\n<p>-Dig for combo cards (obviously)<\/p>\n\n<p>-Overdraw to deal with agenda flooding (obviously)<\/p>\n\n<p>-Bait the a runner familiar with the deck into a run by bluffing an Atlas, Hostile Takeover, or Posted Bounty<\/p>\n\n<p>-Especially: You're 10 turns in and you've only seen 1 Shutdown, and you're hurting for one. Put the Shutdown back in, upping the odds of getting one. Along with it, put those Oversight AIs back in. Each one is essentially a click for 10 - 14 credits if left uncontested for a single turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>-You've just hit them with Midseason and stuck them with enough tags that they can't clear for several turns (somewhere between 8 and 12 probably). You're holding 3 Scorches. They have 2 Plascretes and 4 cards in hand. Play the Scorches. They probably won't be running any time soon. Sure the Scorch threat is gone, until you rez a Jackson Howard and put all 3 Scorches back in. What does a runner do with that? Most will say they aren't sure; most will say \"go hard and try to win before they draw them back\". Do you have an Atlas Token? Once you draw 1, you win. Atlas search for the other, and 8 meat damage later the game is over. More on this below.<\/p>\n\n<p>-Biotic Recursion. You have the Biotic, you're holding an Atlas. Your primary objective is to get that Atlas on the table, unadvanced, in a scoring window if you can. The runner should not be able to run your remote without disparity growing to about 20 credits anyway, which brings the Midseason into the picture, but we've covered that. If they don't run it, Biotic Labor, advance 4 times. Now you're at 3 points (unlike previous Keystone variants, I'm finding it's actually quite helpful to score your first HT early since you start at 5 credits instead of 10 like in GRNDL); a Biotic in Archives, and waiting on a Jackson. Jackson draw for another agenda. Is it an Atlas. Jackson the Biotic back in, Atlas search it, and score the Atlas out of hand if you have to. Or install unadvanced into a remote, then go for Biotic and churn another Atlas with a token out. You're at match point with huge ice on the board and the ability to get any card you want. You're in a good place. More on the plays Biotic opens up below.<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Biotic Labor<\/strong>: A power card, the downside of which is its cost. But in an archetype where the theme is basically \"money is no object\", it fits perfectly. There are basically 2 reasons for Biotic; First, as mentioned above, letting you chain Project Atlas. Atlas is the cornerstone agenda of ANY Weyland deck right now (until OaC of course, and probably still beyond that). It is Weyland's Astroscript. Not overadvancing this is basically not an option. It might have well have been printed as a 4\/2 that gets a token on scoring it out, but it is better than that: Every advancement beyond the 3rd gives you an Atlas token, meaning scoring it as if it were a 5\/3 gives you the ability to have 2 cards out of your deck, ANY CARD, any time you want. That effect is WORTH 4 credits. If there was a card that was cost 4 and said <em>When you play this operation gain a click. This card may be played during the runners turn during any paid ability window. Search R&amp;D for any card, reveal it, and add it to HQ. Shuffle your deck.<\/em> Would you play it? Are you kidding me? Of course you would, that card sounds completely bananas. Using Biotic as a 4-credit means to get cards out of your R&amp;D when you need them is ALWAYS, I mean <strong>ALWAYS<\/strong> worth it.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>-Minor secondary use of Biotic: You have a giant amount of credits. The runner has not installed plascrete, and perhaps they don't even run them because of NEH being so prevalent and Scorch decks becoming more uncommon. You have had some strong draws, and have 20 - 25 credits from bouncing Hadrian's\/Curtain Walls. The runner has been less fortunate, and doesn't want to risk running against you just yet, because they know you can bounce a big barrier if they run and score against you and smash you the tag\/scorch\/scorch combo you might be holding. But what you DO have in hand, as coincidence would have it, is a Posted Bounty, a Biotic, and a Single Scorch. Install the Posted Bounty on your first click, then do other things; Perhaps ice up centrals, or OAI a Curtain\/Hadrian's Wall, play a Hedge Fund, continue to set up your centrals and your late-game economy. What does the runner do on their turn? Likely, set up their rig. Or, run a central to force some ice rez\/economy denial to help close the credit gap, then jack out, so they don't get the successful run\/SEA Source. Even a smart player will think, \"what could that be? He didn't advance it after installing it. I know he will want to overadvance his Atlas, and can't afford to lose it, so it must not be that. Weyland does not have access to any other 3\/2 agendas. Is it a Profiteering or Chronos Protocol perhaps? At worst, it's only 1 point, and not worth getting Scorched over. Even if it's a Posted Bounty, I have another turn to close the credit, can advance it three times next turn, and then the turn AFTER that he can forfeit it to hit me with Scorches. I'll econ up this turn, and wait to see if it gets advanced, and then run it if it does.\" With PB sitting naked behind that remote ice, you can Biotic, triple advance, and single Scorch in a turn. Alternatively, if they DO run it regardless of it being unadvanced, they just took the agenda you want the least in the deck, and turned on Midseason, and likely spent a few credits getting in, meaning bouncing a big barrier will ensure a tagstorm. Jackson draw for the scorches ASAP and smash through their Plascrete and close the game out.<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Targetted Marketing<\/strong>- Wow is this card great for this deck. 10 Credits is the PERFECT amount, because it means you can hard rez a Hadrian's which means you have a (likely) 7-credit taxing barrier that can be liquidated back into 10 credits if ever the need should arise. It didn't require an OAI, waiting a turn, hoping they don't derez it, etc. Don't play this first turn. Once you have enough ice out that the runner needs to start playing cards, play it. 3rd round of swiss in the tournament I just won, a runner overdrew with Professional Contacts early on in the round, digging for another breaker or tutor after I used a Power Shutdown to trash his SMC 3rd turn. After overdrawing, he discarded Ghost Runner (he was playing Chaos Theory) so on my turn (with 2 Enigmas guarding R&amp;D and HQ) I played Targetted Marketing and named Refractor. 3 turns later he had no choice but to play the Refractor and give me the 10 credits. Once again, it only has to work once, and then it's 1 click for 10 credits. I'll take it. Alternate things to name: Emergency Shutdown, Inside Job, Same Old Thing, Test Run, Clone Chip. You are a program trashing machine, so recursion cards are an easy one to name. Your big credit-generating barriers are vulnerable to Emergency Shutdown, so that is another strong card to name if playing against a Criminal. Sneakdoor\/Inside Job to HQ and then play Emergency Shutdown on the Hadrian's I have on HQ. That's conservatively 2 clicks and 2 cards to deny me 10 credits, and in doing so, you give me 10 credits. I would like to find space for more of these because drawing it late game (happened once during tournament) means it serves little use.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><strong>Possible Changes<\/strong>: <\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Targetted Marketing did great work, and 10 credits synergizes so well with your bread-and-butter 'economy' card: Hadrian's Wall. Unsure of the direction to take the deck in, considering influence constraints, though. I could go for a three-of by cutting Information Overload, but with Atlas, Information Overload does SO much work when the Midseason lands. Will continue to play test, but running a 1-of for 1 influence is really not bad as-is. It's nice when I draw it, and almost always useful, except at match point, and even then, sometimes useful when the economic battle is neck-and-neck and you are both at match point. If you've been controlling their board state through Power Shutdown and Destroyers you should be able to think of something to name that the runner will need, which will give you the 10 you need to rez the Hadrian's guarding your agendas, wherever they are.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I could not believe the power of Midseason Replacements in this deck. Any of you familiar with previous Keystone Variants using GRNDL know that I'm a huge advocate for a single Biotic labor in Weyland rush decks, but wow, the consistency that a second Midseason would bring to the table would be devastating to a runner. Conversely, though, having 2 dead draws at match point taking up 8 influence is less than optimal and funnels you into an early game kill-or-be-killed strategy, which is not what this deck is about. Instead of running 1 SEA and 1 Midseason, running 2 Posted Bounty along with a single Biotic gives me more options, options that do not depend on having more money than the runner through a trace like both SEA and Midseason do, and more importantly, can spring a Scorch at you from seemingly nowhere using a power card like Biotic Labor that as it stands now is only used to fast-advance agendas. The utility of Biotic Labor is simply unmatched in this deck when you considering, for all intents and purposes, that money is no object.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Elizabeth Mills made very little impact, other than a couple of runners in the tournament saying \"Wow, that's a pretty awesome interaction\" to me as I melted away 2 Bad Pub from a Geothermal Fracking I had scored earlier and taken the 14 from. As with all previous Keystone variants, bad pub did not matter. The idea was, you can have bad pub, you won't have anything to spend it on in your runs because you don't have the right breakers, because I keep trashing them. When a server costs 12 to get through, making it cost 10 instead does not matter, when Midseason and Reversed Accounts are online. This deck is so so potent, Bad Pub is inconsequential, because a mistake still means your death or me scoring out, regardless of the adorable 3 credits you'll have for this run. At no point in the tournament did I have more than 3 bad pub, and 3 in only 1 game, the rest of the games, 2. This will definitely be cut, but for what, I am unsure. I really enjoyed the power of Taurus, so I may consider a second one in place of E.M.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>On Geothermal Fracking vs. Corporate War: The synergy of Corporate War is undeniably great with Blue Sun, and in a more Glacier-centric deck, I feel it is a better fit than Geothermal Fracking. However, Corporate War can require you to bounce a piece of ice at the beginning of the turn you score it out to get its credit benefit. Granted, so what, because you get 7 credits for FREE and don't have to spend any additional clicks. <em>However<\/em>, for this deck Geothermal is better. You do not gain the clickless 7 credits, but instead you have access to <em>fourteen<\/em> credits at the cost of two clicks; fourteen credits that cannot be taken from you by any card currently in print. They cannot be Siphoned from you, they cannot be taken from you when you spend 10 of your last 15 credits on a Hadrian's the following turn on HQ as your criminal opponent Siphons you to force a rez, and then Emergency Shutdowns the ice. Geothermal is a recovery tool. It gaps you over from Atlas to Atlas, it gives you back the money that is being deprived of you as your Shaper opponent tutors for a D4v1d and breakers the OAI Hadrian's, or your criminal opponent Inside Job\/Emergency Shutdowns it. With Midseason in hand and Geothermal Fracking scored, they need to have (let's throw a number out) 14 credits more credits than you when they take an agenda from you, something that is borderline inconceivable, since you could bounce a piece of ice, pull 2 Geothermal tokens (being ridiculous here for the purpose of driving home a point), and Midseason last click as you have (15, 20) more credits than them. The credit swings are just so strong for this deck when using Geothermal Fracking; once again, the money from Fracking is 'safe', stored 'offshore' until it is needed. With those tokens you always have the money for a 10-str 3-subroutine barrier in a pinch.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Using 3 Enigmas as the only code gate in the deck was a great idea, and really the only sensible one. Quandary dies instantly to parasite, so with it out of the picture, it's also the obvious choice. I used these to great effect during the tournament, rezzing the same Enigma on a different server each time against a whole variety of different runners at least 3 times per game, which is almost a whole turn lost through the course of the early-to-mid-game stretch. Getting it early is incredible when you have so much program destruction; while Gordian Blade is not feasible to Power Shutdown, it costs 4, and with Grim and Archer (and Taurus) floating around, all unrezzed, the Faerie or Clone Chip you play to protect it will be hit with a Power Shutdown, or a rezzed Taurus\/Grim to force you to use it, so that the Gordian Blade doesn't stick around for too long. At a cost of 4, it provides a nice tempo hit for you to work with. Other popular code gate breakers being Yog, which is dealt with the same way (out of faction anyway) or Passport, easy to Shutdown at a cost of 1. With Corroder still being very popular (for now anyway, Blue Sun's presence might change that), it's actually not a high-priority target for Power Shutdowns (although I won't pass an opportunity if it presents itself) because Corroder equals 10 - 12 credit runs, and the Faerie\/SMC\/Passport\/Clone Chip that is played along-side it is an obvious target to keep the Enigmas doing work.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Hades Fragment is such a strong ability, but like I touched on at the outset of this article, 3-pointers are SO hard to score as Weyland. You really can't afford 2 full turns of advancing in this style of deck without bouncing\/shuffling\/installing ice to keep the threat present. A single 3-pointer is necessary to get the agenda points up to the 20-21 level, so I thought, hey, this is perfect. Scoring this puts OAI, Biotic, Power Shutdown, Reversed Accounts, Hedge Funds, trashed Hadrian's\/Curtains, all kinds of good things back into R&amp;D and ready for Atlas to come get them, or for me to Jackson shuffle them and try to draw them. In practice though, it's a cute idea, but I would rather go all-in on a single copy of The Cleaners. Pri-Req might seem an obvious choice, but I don't want a 3-pointer that I have to hold while I get a piece of ice set up that I can score to rez, while having enough economy and board state that if I DON'T Pri-Req rez it, I'm still ahead. The Cleaners means a triple Scorch is a Flatline through 2 Plascretes. THAT seems like the kind of 3-pointer that would fit this deck. Not something I need, but if I score it, it's always on. In a deck where money is not terribly hard to come by, that uses Midseasons to stick the tags, this seems like the way to go, if any. If I don't draw it, whatever. If it gets scored, fine. If I think I have an opportunity to score it, sure, I'll go for it, because I'll know whether or not my board state will allow me to recover in the event it gets stolen. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Weaknesses<\/strong>: De-rez effects, cards that efficiently break large ice (Knight, Breach, D4v1D). I do not foresee \"Lady\" Cerberus H1 being an issue; at 4 cost and only 3 strength, with 4 uses to it, a Curtain wall is 4 (installed) + 7 (boost) and 3 counters to break, for a total of 11. Spend 11 to keep me from getting 14? No problem. The 4 strength also means on-the-board recursion (Clone Chip) are easy targets for Power Shutdown; although Scavenge and Test Run would take some thought to play around. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Breach is very cost-effective, and great for denial of credits from OAI, but is not played often. Adding a single Breach to your deck is a strong option for a Blue Sun matchup. This will mean the battle will be over control of sentry breakers through Grim\/Archer\/Power Shutdown, or installed a Hadrian's in front of a Curtain wall on HQ, then OAI'ing the Curtain wall, to force an Inside Job or to force the large credit expenditure to break Hadrian's AND Curtain Wall. This leaves your archives vulnerable (likely) to a Sneakdoor\/E.Shutdown combo, but this will be inevitable against any criminal matchup; You have to be sure you have enough economy in your credit pool or on the board to be able to bounce back from a de-rez effect.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I had D4v1D recursion used against me to great effect during second round swiss by Exile, who would go out of his way to recur D4v1D and run through my OAI'ed ice to control my economy. I had not anticipated this weakness until it happened, and the first Curtain Wall he trashed with a D4v1D was a real shot to the gut. Knowing Exile tricks, I played a slow econ game while aggressively Jackson-digging for Power Shutdowns and Hedge Funds, and trashed his Clone Chips after he used SMC for D4v1D, which he used Scavenge on to replenish the power counters of. This kept him from easy access to his Opus, since his tutors were being trashed\/used to recurr D4v1D. Regardless, this is a card to be aware of, and is certainly the Anarch 'silver bullet' answer to how to pressure a corp with monstrous ice while having between 4 and 8 credits all game, since you're Anarch.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Blue Sun lets Weyland do something they've desperately needed to do for a LONG time: Force a runner to run against them. A smart runner would just econ up and poke your servers, and it turned the Scorch off, and they finally draw Plascretes, or clear Kati for 18, and now you're hopeless. OAI in Blue Sun means you can say, \"Come steal from me. I'll kill you. If you don't run against me, I'll gain 14 credits at the beginning of my next turn. Then you'll have a BIGGER problem. Or you can risk me holding the kill combo and run through the OAI ice to deny the credits and then jack out; That turns on Power Shutdown (which requires a run but <em>not<\/em> a successful run) which I'll use to punish you for stopping me from gaining my credits.\" I've been playing Weyland a long time, and just like many other Weyland players, I saw the problems in the play style. HB did everything Weyland did, but better, just by being HB and splashing Weyland Cards (Punitive Flatlines are so much better when your ice is enormously taxing and you play a ton of 3 pointers, GRNDL Refinery is not something you 'need' in HB but is a powerful economy card\/run instigator, Power Shutdowns are great because HB has some of the best recursion cards in faction) and so even strong and dedicated Weyland players were running out of reasons to keep playing Weyland. Blue Sun is the reason to come back. The unparalleled versatility, the ACTUAL threat of a flatline and not just \"they played 2 Plascretes, the game is over because I haven't been drawing while I hold a SEA Source and 3 Scorches\", the incredible credit disparities you can force the runner into... <\/p>\n\n<p>All the pieces of the puzzle are there now, fellow Weyland Players. Time to pick yourself back up by your bootstraps and bring some representation back into your local meta. Give runners a reason to run those awesome-looking Plascrete alt-arts again.<\/p>\n","username":"ItJustGotRielle","cards":{"01059":1,"01094":3,"01095":2,"01099":3,"01101":3,"01102":3,"01103":3,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02018":3,"02079":3,"02116":1,"04015":3,"04017":3,"04020":1,"04037":1,"04058":3,"04078":2,"06009":1,"06026":1,"06027":1,"06066":1,"06068":1,"06071":1}},

Out of 8 games played, Exile won 6.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is based on two principles, gamble for days and having the perfect solution for every problem.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those of you not familiar with gamble for days, this is an economy package that originated in Kate. Typically focusing on playing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a> for free using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01033\">Kate \"Mac\" McCaffrey: Digital Tinker<\/a>'s ability onto <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04022\">Scheherazade<\/a>, which nets you 4 credits. Effectively turning <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a> into <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a>. It gets further value if you are able to then sell the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a> to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>. However, this economy suite has been modified to be very efficient in <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03030\">Exile: Streethawk<\/a>. By using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03047\">Sahasrara<\/a>, you can turn almost any program into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a>. Since you play a toolbox style deck, you don't need every card for every match. This means that you can start installing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01045\">Net Shield<\/a> netting 4 credits when playing against Blue Sun. The other strength of using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03030\">Exile: Streethawk<\/a> is added tempo for many of the events you play. For instance, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a> turns into a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01050\">Sure Gamble<\/a> that draws a card.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a note, I firmly believe that this deck could not be better if it were <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01033\">Kate \"Mac\" McCaffrey: Digital Tinker<\/a>. Exile's ability gives you upside on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03034\">Scavenge<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02047\">Test Run<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a>. This is huge because it provides the tempo that allows you to keep your economy high. You always need to be installing a program to sell the next turn to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>, so being able to draw without spending a click helps. In addition, Exile is able to preform multiple things at the end of the corporation turn before the runner turns begins. For instance, grabbing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a> via <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03038\">Clone Chip<\/a> at the end of the corp. turn. This draws you a card, nets you 7 credits (4 for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06037\">Cache<\/a>, 3 for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01047\">Aesop's Pawnshop<\/a>), all before your turn begins.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other half of the deck is based around having the right tool for the right job. This deck plays like it has a fluid rig.

{"identity":"images/NBNTWiY.png","id":22037,"name":"When the Flash Wears Yellow! V.2 (Undefeated Bratislava Regi","creation":"2015-06-08 15:43:04","description":"<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck went undefeated (7 wins, no losses) in the Bratislava Regionals, where more than a couple of great Netrunner players where found (including the awesome @PeekaySK, two German Store Champ winners, an Irish Store Champ, and my great Budapest buddies \u2014among whom one can find the actual winner of the tournament: Mr. Flekk). <\/p>\n\n<p>I came in 2nd Seed after 5 rounds of Swiss, and 4th place overall after top 8 double-elimination. My losses where all due to a combination of my dear Kate deck misbehaving and a few miscalculations (2 wins, 5 loses) that had terrible consequences (plus facing NEH 3 times and Jinteki RP 3 times diminishes the chances of winning for any runner). <\/p>\n\n<p>My Corp faced the following runners: Hayley, Kim (twice), Leela (twice), Chaos Theory and @PeekaySK's Whizzard. However, I've been play-testing this deck for a couple of weeks, and it consistently does well against any and all runners. <\/p>\n\n<p>I have to give a shout-out to @CrusNB who also tested and commented on the first version of this deck; his suggestion of changing three Pop-ups for three Quandaries; and three W.o. Static for three Wraparounds are what put the finishing touches on a truly powerful deck. <\/p>\n\n<p>All in all I am most proud of this deck because I believe it is somewhat original and it mostly uses old-school cards: I've never seen anyone else play NBN with Green Level and Blue Level Clearance and an excess of economy events. I do believe that this kind of deck is the reason that cards like Paper Tripping needed to exist. <\/p>\n\n<p>STRATEGY<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck can be even faster than NEH, and is surprisingly consistent. By merely having a look at the deck-list it is obvious you just make a bunch of money and then Midseasons\/Psycho for the win. The less easy part of piloting the deck is choosing when and where to ICE up, and when to Midseasons (it is not always the case that you should Midseasons if the runner stole an agenda the past turn). Other than that, it is pretty easy to pilot for any half-good Netrunner player who should be able to learn how to use it effectively just after a few games. By far, the most important thing for piloting this deck is knowing what kind of plays the Runner is bound to do: this is where one's understanding of the card pool and the ID play-style archetypes is important.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another important thing to understand is that you do not need to defend your agendas to score them. If the runner knows how the deck works (and if you find yourself at somewhere around twice their credits) then you can just install and advance an agenda naked: the runner knows that stealing the agenda will allow you to hyper-tag them and then Pscycho-score any and all agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>I will only give a simple rundown of various cards to explain their utility in the deck and how to best use them. It is ideal to just play around with the deck and learn how to use it like that; though the last thing that is important to know is that given how powerful the economy can be, it is not always important to begin the game with ICE in hand, if you begin with economy and Midseasons, it might be the perfect beginning (it all depends on the runner one is facing mostly). It is hilarious to score a Project Beale for 3 pts only because the runner is afraid of stealing naked agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for the card rundown:<\/p>\n\n<p>CORPORATE SHUFFLE: this is the crown jewel of this deck if only because everyone looks at it funny when they see it for the first time. I'm not saying this card is never used by other players, but I do believe that it is an interesting add for many decks. In this particular deck it is great for three things: (1) dealing with agenda flood, (2) drawing a Midseasons when you need it, (3) drawing up cards if you went down to 1 or 2 cards in hand and want to draw-up efficiently. <\/p>\n\n<p>BLUE LEVEL CLEARANCE (BLC): This is by far one of my favorite cards in the game. It offers a very staple-like function: economy and draw. However, this card shines in this deck due to the base 6 hand-size. This means that NBN TWIY can use BLC on turn 1 and not have to discard to go down to 5 at end of turn (if you use it turn 1 in any other deck,  then you go up to 7 cards and only have one click left to play a card). BLC (together with Green LC) is also very important in so far as it simultaneously offers economy and draw for quickly finding the few ICE in the deck and other key combo cards (Midseasons and Psychographics).<\/p>\n\n<p>TOLLBOOTH: the best of NBN ice, it is important for two reasons: having a strong ice that can tax the runner in a server that needs a bit more protection, or for a creating a one ICE scoring window for an Astroscript. It is a good ice overall and needs little explanation.<\/p>\n\n<p>WRAPAROUND: the first version of this deck had three Wall of Static instead, just to be able to tax 2creds from Corroder users. However, I was later convinced by @CrusNB that Wraparound is much stronger where strength was truly needed: against pesky Eater decks that can become too fast and strong in the early game if one doesn't manage to rezz taxing ICE against it. <\/p>\n\n<p>QUANDARY: the first version of this deck had three Pop-ups instead, if only because they are so thematically NBN-ish, but again @CrusNB convinced me that the deck needed more ETR ICE, and Quandary has played a HUGE role in making this deck as fast as it can be: in just one turn you can create a scoring window with a cheap server of Quandary, Wraparound and an Astroscript. Also, it adds more ETR subroutines in the deck, so that Eater decks have a harder time actually accessing cards in a server. <\/p>\n\n<p>ERRAND BOY: this is another piece of ice that is very thematic within the deck: make all the money &amp; draw all the cards. The other cool thing about this little piece of ice is that it can be rezzed for 1cred: runners often face-check NBN ICE due to the little threatening ICE they usually include, hence, you rezz for 4 and gain 3creds back (or do whatever is needed at the moment). It then becomes an ICE that taxes most breakers for 3creds while it only costs you 1cred to rezz! In any case, I've always wanted to make a deck with Errand Boy where it would fit-in as a key card, and not just a nice inclusion: Errand Boy truly is a key card in this deck, especially becuase the runner often doesn't want to break it.<\/p>\n\n<p>CLOSING STATEMENTS<\/p>\n\n<p>A great detail about the economy of this deck is also its capacity to recuperate quickly form going down in credits after a big Midseasons or after some Siphons. Having economy cards that can be activated at multiple thresholds (1credit, 2 credits, 5 credits, and 10 credits) makes it so that you can easily go from 0 credits to 9 credits in just one turn. This deck can truly use Jackson in very efficient ways depending on the game, using it to constantly get back ICE that is killed or economy cards that will allow for the come back, or economy cards that will allow you to maintain your economic supremacy (e.g., shuffling back 3 Restructures if you already find yourself at 20+ credits.)<\/p>\n\n<p>No, Account Siphon recursion is not this deck's weakness (it is often no more than an inconvenience). The runner doesn't start the game with all their Account Siphons and recursion in hand, so it is merely a loss of 5 credits from time to time. Also, with Psychographics it is possible to FA agendas if the runner is floating the Acc Siphon tags (install agenda, Psychographics for two advancement tokens, and advance once more with last click). Hence, annoying Siphon tag floaters need to constantly remove tags or you can still fast advance you stuff (tag floaters basically do half the job for you: you don't need to Midseasons them, you just need to draw into a Psychographics and an Astroscript or whatever; which is not hard in a small deck with a lot of draw and Corporate Shuffle).<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck's weakness is a combination of bad piloting, incredibly good luck on the runners side &amp; \u2014perhaps\u2014 an early Magnum Opus combined with a slow start for the Corp.<\/p>\n","username":"benticurus","cards":{"01081":3,"01085":3,"01090":1,"01110":3,"02070":3,"02114":1,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04015":3,"04040":3,"04076":3,"04090":3,"04096":3,"04113":1,"04119":3,"04120":3,"06102":3}},

From nowhere, a player called Waldemar swooped in and got 3rd place at the North-German regionals. I used the deck myself  since then and got 5th place in at the West-German regionals with little to no training. Another player (Putzlappen) won a qualifier tournament for the German Nationals with it (DMQT).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Let's Talk Mandatory Upgrades<\/h2>\n\n<p>The deck has 3 of the agenda <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a>. It sounds like a joke but this deck list should really make you re-consider the agenda. The goal here is to score the agenda the regular way. No tricks. Just slow-advance it up to 6 in a taxing scoring server. Here are some reasons why this is so powerful.<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>If you get the agenda scored, you pretty much won the game. The fact that you can fast-advance many agendas isn't even the main advantage. Just having 4 click turns is huge. You can purge and install. You can keep developing the board while churning out agendas. You can advance a previously installed agenda, score it and put another agenda in that scoring server ready to go next turn. The click advantage means you are likely to pull ahead of the runner very quickly.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The advancement requirement of 6 sounds daunting since you need 3 turns to score it. But it's actually quite doable. You even have some leeway since you don't need to spend ALL of the clicks of those 3 turns to keep advancing the agendas. A move I like to do its <strong>Install, advance<\/strong> on the first turn to fake out an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>. Next turn <strong>advance, advance<\/strong> and use the 3rd click to keep developing the board. This second turn will often seriously confuse the runners. Are you baiting them into a super-taxing run on a NAPD? Is this an HB trap? Or is this just an awkward 5\/3 score? The final turn is then <strong>advance, advance, advance, score<\/strong>. It gives you immediatly a 4th click on that turn. Note how you have an extra click on every turn of the scoring process to let you develop the board state, play <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a> or whatever you need to keep tabs on.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Your servers are taxing enough to keep an agenda safe for longer than just 2 turns. Especially Noise often simply lacks the tools to seriously contest a server with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01091\">Red Herrings<\/a> in it. Most players won't even try, not expecting the kind of advantage you will get from scoring it.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Finally, the most important advantage of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> is that it is a 2-pointer. I've never seen anybody comment on it, but this is huge. There are no 3-pointers in the deck. Which means both players needs to score 4 agendas to win. If the runner does manage to break into your scoring server and steal the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> they just get 2 points. And they will likely open up the scoring window to drive a second agenda through. The agenda seems like you are going out on a limb, but it is actually much less risky than most 3-pointers people are happy to run with.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The reason why there are 3 agendas in here is because you WANT to have it on hand when that magical scoring window opens. You also want to be able to lose it in a central server run and still have that option. Finally, you can try to make the runner concede by scoring 2x <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a>. Why not?<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>Asset Economy<\/h2>\n\n<p>Your have all the asset economy in the world. It will either make you rich or it will make the runner poor (and you still will be rich). Runners usually really don't have the economy to trash all your assets. To twist the knife, you also have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02029\">Encryption Protocol<\/a>. There really is no good play against those. They can trash them, but they will waste money and time. They can keep them around but that will make your assets untouchable and, as an added benefit, your upgrades like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01091\">Red Herrings<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06048\">Crisium Grid<\/a> become untouchable as well. You can easily get moments where the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02013\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY<\/a> trace will be cheaper than its trash cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's why <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01091\">Red Herrings<\/a> is here. This deck is all about financial supremacy and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01091\">Red Herrings<\/a> allows you to leverage that even more. I had games where I played it on R&amp;D making the runners bite their lips as I parade my agendas in front of their eyes on a super taxing multi-access R&amp;D run.<\/p>\n\n<p>Playing the assets requires some planning. Playing them naked may work against some Shapers. Against Criminals you'll just create servers for Security Testing. Anarchs have the Imp. Better protect your assets. Don't shy away from putting an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02092\">Eve Campaign<\/a> behind a Tollbooth. Play your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a> in the scoring server. You want to create those win\/win situations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Imp may sound like a problem but it rarely is. It is very taxing for Anarchs to contest assets servers when they are protected by your ice. Don't shy away from purging virus tokens to seal the deal. You have time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cards you may have issues with are Scrubber and Whizzard. Neither of those are very popular though. And they just mean you need to tax by protecting the asssets a bit better.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Changes<\/h2>\n\n<p>The decklist here is not the original deck by Waldemar. I swapped 1 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06041\">IQ<\/a> against 1 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06111\">Excalibur<\/a> for some additional tactical options.  I've seen some people replacing the IQs with Enigmas and additional Vipers.

I was doing it for kicks! It looked like a fun card, that could build a different deck and, hey! I already won a Store Championship, I can just play whatever and have fun, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, I did have fun. The five Runners I flatlined...not so much.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck looks awful on paper: 54 cards, a hodgepodge of upgrades, three copies of Interns, and ICE that is both prone to Parasite and extremely expensive to rez. But it works. It works hard. And is very punishing towards the Runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>What this deck does is force the Runner into a cycle of bad decisions, that can be boiled down to this:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) They need to trash cards, specially Hokusai Grid and economics assets. But they can't do it while Hostile Infrastructure is on the table.\n2) They can't trash Hostile Infrastructure because it's too expensive, they need to run archives first.\n3) After running archives, they don't have enough cards and money to trash anything, so they sit back and click for credits and cards.\n4) While they recover, assets pay off their profits, archive starts to fill back again and any trashed card of importance is brought back by Interns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, the deck combies the taxing aspects of both HB and Jinteki PE. It's a glacier deck that taxes cards, clicks and credits, constraining the Runner and preventing him from making runs. Going through Tsurugi, trashing Hokusai Grid for 11 while taking an extra point of damage from Hostile Infrastructure just to faceplant a NAPD or a Snare! is not pleasant so runs are few and very damaging.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck is also extremely hard to control economically because of the increased costs of trashing and the free turns not being able to run gives it. The usual denial tactics (Parasite, Siphon, etc.) are often a expensive in clicks and cards that is better spent elsewhere and, in practice, I wasn't bothered by either of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Really, it's an absurdly powerful deck and I didn't expect it to be. Hard to play, though, you must take care not to be forced to play your Jacksons early in the game.<\/p>\n\n<p>I decided to run 54 cards to prevent self-milling, some matchups will go long and you really need those five extra turns to score and win. The influence is not neccessary and can be probably spent on a better Code Gate than Lotus Field, because I hate how it becomes blank if the Runner plays Atman or Torch.<\/p>\n\n<p>So yeah, I'm afraid I've created a monster.

The vast majority of these are flatlines. One loss was from having two agendas including a GT stolen early, and the other was from not seeing an agenda the entire game due to noise mill.<\/p>\n\n<p>[Advice on how to actually play the deck is in Part 2, immediately below are the more general observations]<\/p>\n\n<p>Part 1 - General observations on changes since the previous version<\/p>\n\n<p>The MVP award on the day went to... Government Takeover! Despite the fact that the one loss came from having this card stolen in my first game it directly won me three games, including one hilarious encounter where I installed and advanced it in an empty server on turn 4 in order to bait an anarch into stealing it... they then died to punitive counterstrike, as having two clicks to find a plascrete was an impossible task.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every time this card appeared the game ended in the next term after a punitive. Despite the fact that I know it will lose you games I am starting to think that overall its inclusion increases the power of this deck. There is doubtless a debate to be had here, ultimately its inclusion WILL lose you games, and whether this is actually worth it in a deck that was already winning almost every game remains to be seen. In the long run I'm still not sure if I will keep it. I guess it depends how willing I am to embrace variance XD <\/p>\n\n<p>Given that I am running with a mere six agendas this deck has the lowest agenda density conceivable, freeing up deck space and meaning that early runs generally yield no points for the runner. <\/p>\n\n<p>The ice composition has changed slightly from the previous version, I have removed the Janus 2.0s and replace them with two snares and a cerebral overwriter. The snares are to discourage deep RnD digs, and the cerebral is there to bait the run into hitting what they think is a Government Takeover only to take significant brain damage. The remaining ice has been switched to largely barriers that simply tax the runner to enter any server. I have found that most decks rapidly run out of money when facing this composition, and can only run sporadically. Even D4v1D decks often struggle, as they simply cannot recurr enough to continuously break so many barriers subroutines - essentially they run out of steam.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main changes are in the ICE composition and, I have removed the datapikes and replaced them with fire walls - these cost only 1 credit more to play, but each taxes eater 4 credits per break.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is to tax eater out the game. The new anarch builds have some economy, but I don't think it's enough to deal with the obstacles this deck gives them. Specifically I would aim to OAI a curtain wall behind a firewall, meaning that knifed will have serious problems getting through to the curtain. <\/p>\n\n<p>Part 2 - How To Play!<\/p>\n\n<p>[Description from previous version, Universally Blue Explosions v3]<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck has an extremely high kill potential, as it is packing both scorched earth and punitive counterstrike. In practice this means that the corp almost always has a viable flatline threat. The deck is capable of mercilessly punishing any mistakes the runner makes.<\/p>\n\n<p>The agenda composition synergise is well with blue Sun and is extremely potent in a deck with this much meat damage - a single scored cleaners can often render a plascrete carapace irrelevant, as the scorched combo now does 10 meat damage. I have yet to lose a game after scoring two copies of the cleaners. As always a priority requisition is strong with blue sons innate ability, and after order and chaos I will be replacing the Eden fragment with a high risk investment.<\/p>\n\n<p>The low agenda density reduces the risk of early one steals, and often means that you know not to protect either HQ or RnD depending on the composition of your hand. Agenda flood is almost non-existent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shattered remains has been a truly potent counter to plascrete, and I have achieved several kills when one is with two plascretes have run one of these installed in a server, only to lose them both and then get scorched. I have even install an advanced one naked in a new server, and often find that one as well run not expecting this outcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>The research station is an unusual choice, and a personal favourite of mine. When you are packing so much meat damage it is difficult to maintain enough cards in hand. Research station frequently allows me to maintain a double scorch as well as three punitive counterstrike in hand, meaning that regardless of what actions the runner takes they are in a bad situation. It also reduces the chance of having agendas pulled from HQ, and if the runner pays to trash them this can be highly risky, as the six credits required can lead to a scorch death. I have found these to be an invaluable inclusion to the deck and the increased hand side put a great deal of pressure on the runner.<\/p>\n\n<p>The operations and economy package are self-explanatory to any Blue Sun player; I have found that this deck regularly ends up with 20 to 30 credits, and have landed multiple triple punitive victories. It is fairly easy to keep the runner poor when they have to run through large servers to steal an agenda, and then you simply return a curtain wall and go for the kill with the triple punitive.<\/p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of both punitive and scorch has also led to several victories based on SEA, scorch, punitive kill combos.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ice composition is also fairly explanatory, with some early game and the game ice. The datapikes have performed incredibly strongly early game against many different opponents, as one as do not expect to lose credits, and the ability to bring them back to handle makes them highly cost efficient. I replaced wall of static with Bastion, simply to be a greater tax on corroder, as 3 to break gets quite painful quite quickly.

It carried <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/16987\/noise-control-v3-1st-place-uncle-s-games-sc-redmond-wa-\">Noise<\/a> to 1st place in the Store Championship at Uncle's Games in Redmond (8 people), and with just one more <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/15914\/sc-season-leela\">Leela<\/a> win in the SC at Card Kingdom would have made the top 8 cut (12th out of 26).<\/p>\n\n<p>The worst thing that can happen to this deck is losing more than one agenda on R&amp;D turn 1; that's the only way this deck has lost so far. I've been testing it for about a month on Jinteki.net to really good results. Even seeming problem match-ups like Edward Kim have not really posed much problem. This deck is rul rul fast. All the tournament wins were in 15 minutes or less.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basic Strategy<\/strong><br \/>\nThis deck is all-in on tag-storm meat damage. Because <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06005\">Near-Earth Hub: Broadcast Center<\/a> is totally balanced and not at all ridiculous, there's enough influence for all three <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched Earth<\/a>, all three <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07022\">Traffic Accident<\/a>, and still 2 influence left-over for whatever else. Why not more Scorched Earths and Traffic Accidents? That's what <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04111\">Reclamation Order<\/a> is for. I've won exactly one game with points during testing online. All meat-space wins have been flatlines.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's hard to say what a \"good\" starting hand is with this deck. There are a lot of ways to make almost anything work. Generally, you don't want more than two agendas, and ideally one of them is <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a>. Other than that, it's nice to see one of the nine assets for turn 1 install and draw, some kind of money, and any one piece of ice to protect the problem server for whatever the match up is. Turn one almost always goes: install a new server to draw, play a money operation\/click for a bit, install ice over HQ or R&amp;D. Very frequently you can sneak out a turn 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01108\">Melange Mining Corp.<\/a> for a huge economic advantage because people will expect it to be the naked <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a> (or some card like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign<\/a> that's not even in the deck).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Getting the Kill<\/strong><br \/>\nThe rest of the game is just a matter of agenda management and getting money. Use Jacksons to control exactly where your agendas are and to draw into your important operations. Once you have <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02116\">Midseason Replacements<\/a>, you just need to make sure you can get the Runner to steal something. Leaving an NAPD in Archives until they want it, installing one naked in a remote server and slow-rolling it, or keeping a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02115\">Project Beale<\/a> in hand are all great ways to make this happen. Leaving R&amp;D <em>just<\/em> porous enough against the right Runner works well too (use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01088\">Data Raven<\/a> for this). <\/p>\n\n<p>The most ideal situation responsible for a significant number of wins with this deck is having Midseason and meat damage in hand then playing install-advance-advance on Breaking News. 90% of the time it doesn't even need to be protected by ice, although Data Raven definitely works really well here. This is the ultimate lose-lose situation for the Runner. If they run and steal Breaking News you get to Midseason them for the kill, and if they leave it on the table you get to score it for the kill. Conveniently, two tags is how many you need for Traffic Accident.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you've landed the Midseason, the game just becomes a race; can the Runner steal enough agendas to win before you put them through the meat grinder? Probably not. An unprotected Runner can be killed with 2x Scorched Earth, 1 each of Scorched Earth and Traffic Accident, or 3x Traffic Accident, so getting any one of those combinations is pretty easy. You also have SO MUCH meat damage. Don't be afraid to play Scorched Earth or Traffic Accident just for value. It will slow the Runner down, and you can always get them back with Jackson and Reclamation Order (it makes the Runner really sad when your turn is Sweeps Week and Reclamation Order for two or three Scorched Earths).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Counterplay<\/strong><br \/>\nThe two big matchups I always worry about in deck building are Account Siphon and Keyhole, especially since Eater became a thing. This deck is naturally resistant to Account Siphon- there's enough economy in here to just power through however many Siphons the Runner wants to play, Data Raven on HQ makes Siphon a much more dangerous play, and the main win-con punishes tags. This deck also has a good amount of natural Eater hate. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a> taxes Eater really heavily until Corroder hits the table, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06067\">Universal Connectivity Fee<\/a> will knock out the Runner's funds, there's plenty of recursion, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06027\">Information Overload<\/a> just outright counters Eater. Once you've landed the Midseason, Information Overload has too many subs for the Runner to deal with and they just start losing their rig until they can't run anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p>I know what some of you are thinking. What about meat damage protection? Don't Plascrete Carapace and I've Had Worse just turn the deck off? And the answer is a solid <em>nope<\/em>. For one, this deck moves so fast that most Runners don't have time to get any protection up and running unless they play Plascrete on turn 1 just in case. Even against Runners who do eventually get some protection online, this deck has ALL THE MEAT DAMAGE. Just burn through their Plascretes and then Reclamation Order the Scorched Earths. Or play all three Scorched Earths in one turn. Traffic Accident is a great finisher here as well; burn through the Plascretes with the big damage, then clean up next turn with Traffic Accident. If you suspect I've Had Worse, shoot with Traffic Accident first to have less chance of hitting the I've Had Worse, then kill with Scorched Earth.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Future Considerations<\/strong><br \/>\nI've thought about switching to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01080\">NBN: Making News<\/a>, but those last two influence points are really crucial and the 2<span class=\"icon icon-recurring-credit\"><\/span> don't really help much until it the game winning play, so they would be sort of wasted. There's also something to be said about the Runner needing to plan for any kind of NEH match up. If the Runner plays really fast to try and race out the Astrotrain, then that only helps you kill them faster.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are three problem card slots that I don't know what to do with.<br \/>\n- <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04111\">Reclamation Order<\/a> feels really important for recurring all the meat damage.... but it's hardly ever necessary. This deck plays so fast that you usually don't need to go get the Scorched Earths back. It has won me exactly one game (in testing), and been hand clog most of the rest of the time.<br \/>\n- <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06067\">Universal Connectivity Fee<\/a>. I seriously don't know what to do with the last two slots of this deck. I've tried <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02020\">Drac\u014d<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01085\">Psychographics<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooth<\/a>, but none of them ever did anything for the deck. UCF is the latest audition, but it has yet to put in much work either.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr<\/strong><br \/>\nThis deck is a really fun, fast, low-energy way to play for the kill. Pair with a slow or thought-intensive Runner; you will usually have 3\/4 of the round left to play the other side.<\/p>\n","username":"jakodrako","cards":{"01081":3,"01082":2,"01088":3,"01099":3,"01108":3,"01110":3,"02055":3,"02056":3,"02115":3,"02116":3,"04015":3,"04076":3,"04096":3,"04111":1,"04119":3,"06005":1,"06027":2,"06067":2,"07022":3}},

Just make sure you're six strength and you've got credits so their Archers can't touch you.

It's obviously also a great econ card and is just great fuel for your fire.<\/p>\n\n<p>Amped Up- The options this card unlocks is huge, it's main use is to set up huge Wanton Destruction plays and it does that great, but I also love it when I'm playing against shell game decks, keep them poor and amped into every remote, it keeps the control in your court and does crazy work...<\/p>\n\n<p>Day job- aside from it being my fav art this card is legit, if you like A. Codebusting this card is for you... I love having huge cards like this to play when the corp leaves me with no new options, it keeps the pressure up and makes them realize they can't just click for credits three times...\nIt's also my fav start aside from account syphon.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deje Vu- This is the card that brings the card together, letting you get the cards MaxX mills feels like a tutor and it lets you recur your mean cards over and over!<\/p>\n\n<p>The Utensils- this was the last peace to the puzzle of this deck, I wasn't sure if I was going to add them at all but after a few games that ended dragging out I needed to find an answer for troublesome ice that I needed to pass on a regular basis, and I found that with this set of cards.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this set putting huge pressure on the late game and acting as sudo economy it's hard for your opponent to make good ice placement choices, and that's a huge part of this deck, MAKE THE CORP REACT TO YOU, keep them off there feet...<\/p>\n\n<p>So after talking with D1en about the number of copies of each he led me to run one less knifed, because early game when I'm checking every ice with Eater barrier are the ones I really don't mind just bouncing off of, I consider that a tempo hit for them...<\/p>\n\n<p>I've had worse- What's not to like about this card! It lets you play fast and loose...<\/p>\n\n<p>It's simple, if you think your going to get schorched hold on to 1-2, I'd even say deje Vu for one if you don't have one, but if you don't think that's a treat then draw with it for power turns! Soo good...<\/p>\n\n<p>Levy- this card resets the deck after 14 turns, it's prob the hardest and most stressful part of playing the deck knowing that you could mill all you ways to bring this back and play it so always keep a recursion card for worse case situations...<\/p>\n\n<p>Retrieval run- It's so demoralizing to a corp that only ices up R&amp;D and HQ only for you to mill into you Femme, retrieval run it in play and account Syphon them right of the hope... This card is so powerful and I'm glad it's in the deck, it opens up a lot of fun plays and keeps the aggression really high!<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure gamble- is PB&amp;J<\/p>\n\n<p>Wanton Distruction- Is the crescendo, wile all your nasty things are working early and forcing the corp to turtle and defend against you this is sitting and waiting to snipe all the juicy agendas that build up in HQ, and with this deck it's completely possible to mill a full hand, and hades shard for the win... And that's the most common win for me (my record is zero to fourteen points in one turn after to 5 card wantons)<\/p>\n\n<p>Box-E- Is a late game card and helps to offset brain damage, acts as scorch protection and fixes the MU if you need to run more breakers... 8\/10 time you won't need it, but the time you do its a life saver...<\/p>\n\n<p>Hades shard- is your \"fuck you\" to Jackson! And more often than not the way you'll win your games with this deck<\/p>\n\n<p>Joshua B.-  Does work! It sets up so many great turns and worst case they always trash him, but that's a win for you because this deck leaves the corp with very little resources and time, so for them to trash josh is very VERY taxing and the face they make after you install another is priceless!<\/p>\n\n<p>Lib account- Just a monster card in this deck, it lets you build econ to ridicules levels but it's also my closed accounts protection, I always leave them with four credits on them to quickly regain after I loose my credits... I know you may be thinking that they will just trash them but again, they don't have the time or resources and if you find them getting a foot hold, just drain them... One of my fav cards in the deck, no question!<\/p>\n\n<p>Same old thing- this is pretty self explanatory...<\/p>\n\n<p>Eater- Is the MVP of the deck, man does this mother fucker do work!!! Face check everything as soon as he's out, keep the pressure up by forcing them to make a choice to arbitrary keeping you from accessing but going broke just to do it...<\/p>\n\n<p>It probably goes without saying but this card makes account syphon, wanton, r run and keyhole work at a level that is unlike any other before it... Eater changed the game!<\/p>\n\n<p>Femme- his is your swordsman protection and also a sniper for huge ice, I upped it to two last min and I'm so glad I did, I forgot how much I love this card!<\/p>\n\n<p>Knight- simply for early aggression and could score you a point or two if the corp trys to score behind BS because eater can't get it... They have no place late game, your basic rig is femme, eater and keyhole... <\/p>\n\n<p>Keyhole- is so painful and scary that once it his the table the corps mind turns into \"how do I stop that!?!?\" And that give you time to set up all your other plays, and if they don't react to it, TEACH THEM TO RESPECT IT LOL!<\/p>\n\n<p>Well that's the deck I've been playing and working on for a long time now and I've played it against almost all archetypes, I really feel that there is no good answer to it yet... I know everyone thinks crisium grid will shut it down but if your opponent if running it just chew up all his ice protecting HQ and trash it over and over, and wile he's constantly reacting to you agendas are building up and will be there later...<\/p>\n","username":"SlySquid","cards":{"01002":3,"01018":2,"01026":2,"01050":3,"02022":3,"02042":3,"02101":2,"03035":1,"03054":3,"04043":3,"04061":2,"06055":1,"06059":1,"07029":1,"07031":2,"07032":3,"07035":2,"07036":3,"07037":2,"07038":1,"07039":2,"07040":3}},

The idea is to make gross amounts of money while using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04043\">Knight<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> to get into servers on demand. Those breakers screamed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02024\">e3 Feedback Implants<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04042\">Deep Red<\/a>, which led to Quetzal being too complimentary to pass up. In addition, <em>the strategy of this deck is to create dead cards in the Corp's deck<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>At Petrie's Family Games 2015 Store Championship, Qimpossible was <em>undefeated<\/em> on the day, after 5 rounds of swiss and 2 runner games in elimination play.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Economy<\/h3>\n\n<p>The earlier <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06056\">The Supplier<\/a> hits the board, the better, but I win plenty of games without him. Once I observed that, I was almost tempted to refactor influence, but the amount Supplier can potentially save is 31, which I cannot pass up.<\/p>\n\n<p>When I say gross amounts of money, I mean 93 creds in the deck (assuming turn 1 Supplier) before factoring in renewable money from <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07055\">Data Folding<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati Jones<\/a>. In most games I was averaging two free creds per turn from Data Folding. It is not uncommon to swell to 25+ creds if the corp is not forcing runs. Sitting on this much cash has a couple effects on opponents.<\/p>\n\n<ol><li><p>Panic. This is an immensely valuable psychological effect on corporation players. When you're staring down a bank of 20 creds and even more in reserve on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02022\">Liberated Account<\/a> or Kati, you no longer have to do math to evaluate if I can get into your remote. I can.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Midseasons, SEA Source and Punitive Counterstrike effectively get shut off as viable win conditions. I love making dead draws fill up HQ just by having money.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Building towards an eventuality where I will run four times on R&amp;D with 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> in play. Did I mention panic?<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Trashable cards will be trashed on access. Asset econ is not safe unless well defended, which can negate the point of the asset. I hope you have enough operation econ to win the game, otherwise you'll be clicking for credits and letting my econ engine completely overtake you.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol><h3>Breakers<\/h3>\n\n<p>Quetzal's ability and E3 make solo barriers paper thin. Most of my opponents wouldn't even bother playing or rezzing barriers until they had 2 in the same server. This makes barriers dead cards for a long time. I love having an early game where potentially one-third of drawn ICE is useless.<\/p>\n\n<p>Knight, Overmind, and E3 work wonders together. Combined with my nearly unlimited bankroll, these breakers let me get into glacial servers with relative ease. The worst card I can see is Swordsman, which I thankfully did not encounter all day.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01011\">Mimic<\/a> are for getting through multiple subroutine Sentries like Komainu, Tsurugi, Errand Boy and the like. Also for saving my butt in the event of Swordsman.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Match-ups<\/h3>\n\n<h4>Weyland<\/h4>\n\n<p>Quetzal has a natural affinity against Weyland and their Barrier-heavy ICE choices. Archer is not too scary with Overmind in play or a Knight in place. Sticking tags on the corp's turn with SEA and Midseasons is difficult with the econ war Quetzal can play. And there are always I've Had Worse to soften the blow. Blue Sun is the trickiest match-up because I have to play Knights very conservatively. Fortunately, Blue Sun tends to run 3-pointers and that benefits my overall strategy.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Jinteki<\/h4>\n\n<p>I haven't faced any Jinteki beyond Genomics, which is an OK match-up. I'm not too worried about PE flatlines with I've Had Worse. RP isn't too bad because I can bounce off a central and dedicate Knights on the scoring remote. A staunchly defensive Tennin could be bad news.<\/p>\n\n<h4>HB<\/h4>\n\n<p>I hope you're not using Bioroids against E3. NEXT Design with bountiful, cheap ETR ICE is problematic. Same is probably true for a NEXT ICE deck. Ideally, my Knifed cards can thin out some of the defense. Biotic Labor is the best card against my Quetzal because I'm not stealing creds, trashing operations, or multi-accessing HQ. <\/p>\n\n<h4>NBN<\/h4>\n\n<p>Most of my points are going to come from Medium digs and brute forcing through R&amp;D ICE. NBN generally isn't putting up enough ICE in remotes to keep me out. This requires Biotic Labor or an unsniped SanSan to get the first Astroscript out. Astrotrain will generally beat me, so it comes down to luck of the draw.<\/p>\n","username":"TheRyanBurke","cards":{"01004":1,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01050":3,"02022":3,"02024":3,"02091":1,"03038":1,"03053":3,"04042":3,"04043":3,"05053":3,"06052":1,"06056":3,"06120":3,"07032":3,"07036":3,"07038":2,"07055":3}},

(31 Players)<\/p>\n\n<p>I feel that this <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a> denial deck is about as good as it gets at the moment.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Soul Siphon<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>There's a really great thread on <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.stimhack.com\/t\/headlock-reina-how-to-make-sure-your-opponent-doesnt-get-to-play-netrunner\/3185\">Stimhack about the \"headlock\" Reina style, created by SamRS<\/a> dedicated to finding what Reina does best post OnC, and both his deck and mine share a lot of similarities. Both attempt to get the corp to stall out on credits and not be able to rez ice. Both play Eater + some sort of RND win-con. Both get rich. The differences are simply in how each deck goes about controlling the game. SamRS's makes rez-cost high and relies on Vamp to reset the game. Soul Siphon plays leaner, looking for the moment to strike. <\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of the deck is pretty simple. Tax the opponent by running HQ frequently to get free peeks. Find your breakers for the ice and keep pressuring until you can Siphon the opponent down to close-to zero, drop a Medium, and start digging RnD. The actual play-style is very close to <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/5823\/anatomy-of-anarchy\">Anatomy of Anarchy<\/a>, except it doesn't play the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02103\">Data Leak Reversal<\/a> + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02042\">Joshua B.<\/a> package. It opts, instead, to access cards, and to keep the ice pressure manageable. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Playing the Deck<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>This isn't an Eater + Keyhole deck.<\/em> The goal of this deck is to <strong>access<\/strong> cards in RnD or HQ or in remotes. In order to do this, it plays Corroder and the Anarch fixed-breakers (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01011\">Mimic<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a>) to be able to invalidate certain troublesome ice and not rely overly heavily on Eater. Essentially, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07040\">Eater<\/a> is a place-holder for the icebreakers you <strong>don't<\/strong> draw. I play it immediately when I find it, and feel relatively safe, but I don't expect to find it every game. <\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, the deck wants to run to keep the corp poor, and then Siphon after checking remotes (to make sure they can't rez stuff to deplete your Siphon). The deck likes to float about 5-10 credits (or more), and feels sad if you drop below 2 (the price of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07036\">Day Job<\/a>). The trick to playing the deck effectively is knowing how expensive trashing things is going to be, and knowing when to build your board and credit up. Try not to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07036\">Day Job<\/a> at 2 credits, because the corp will likely know what you're up to. Try to use it when the corp is \"setting up\" so that you can match or exceed their credits.<\/p>\n\n<p>The strategy here is to set up the RnD lock so that the corp HAS to purge and waste time. You don't really care, because you can just go back in or start getting more ahead. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep it flowing<\/strong> is the key to keeping Reina on top of the corp. That means, don't let cards you don't need clutter up your hand, and try not to get caught with no cash to play things. Keep building your rig. Keep digging through your deck (those familiar with Anatomy of Anarchy will know how aggressively you need to draw). Balance. Balance. Balance. Draw + Draw + Install + ditch something and credit, or Install is just fine. Know that there are multiples of some of the lesser-needed programs early on (that is, if you're playing RP, you probably don't need <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06033\">D4v1d<\/a> until they rez a Tollbooth. If you're playing against HB, you probably want Datasucker + Yog + Eater.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Card Choices<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The program suite<\/strong> is specifically tuned to give me the best chance to draw my answers to a particular matchup or situation. 4 answers to an early Wraparound + Astro rush (d4v1d + corroder). 3 answers to early code gates like Enigma or quandary (Yog.0, Parasite). 5 answers to face planting into Architect (3 Eater + 2 Mimic).<\/p>\n\n<p>Because Anarchs still don't have a tutor for breakers, you need to draw aggressively, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07032\">I've Had Worse<\/a> helps a lot, but sometimes you want to keep that in hand if you suspect Scorched Earth. If you're playing against a Butcher Shop style deck (I played one in Swiss), you want to hold 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07032\">I've Had Worse<\/a> and find all your plascretes. They can Scorch through all your stuff. Don't feel bad <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu<\/a>ing an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07032\">I've Had Worse<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a>. It can save your life.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Crescentus<\/em> exerts immense pressure on the corp's cash. You can go Tollbooth hunting with D4v1d and laugh, you can de-rez (or just <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07039\">Spooned<\/a> a Lotus Field. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Datasucker<\/em> has been phenomenal. I used to not have it in here, but the fact that it makes your runs cheaper and lets you axe troublesome ice with Parasites (or just <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> through Merlin, is awesome. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Vigil<\/em> is the best console for denial. Hands-down, it drew me through my deck once, and on average found me about 6-10 cards. I won two games in top 8 without drawing my Vigil. The deck loves it, and you want to find one, but it's not the end of the world if  you don't see one.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>The trick to using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02022\">Liberated Account<\/a><\/em> in this deck is to play them to use them in a pinch. Don't just use them for cash immediately (unless you NEED that cash immediately). Use them as your Panic Button. You need cash right now? Use them. Can wait? Consider clicking up instead. You will thank your bank account later.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Spooned<\/em> is strictly for troublesome code gates that you can't <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01014\">Yog.0<\/a> through or derez. I generally save this for Lotus field, but I've used it on Inazuma and Wendigo in the past. You don't want more than 1 of these. They clutter the hand. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07038\">Knifed<\/a> is a decent cutlery, but I prefer not to bother with it. These things clutter your hand and you want to keep drawing and finding the things to advance your game-plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Day Job<\/em> is a \"get further ahead\" card. Sometimes it's ok turn 1, but know that the corp can exploit that if they sense you're planning to go sit at a desk all day. <\/p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01002\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu<\/a><\/em> is the most all-purpose card in the deck. It gets you more <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a>s if you need them (you might!) but it also gets back <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02065\">Crescentus<\/a> to keep the pressure on. <\/p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a><\/em> over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04061\">Keyhole<\/a>. Why? Because if I was playing Keyhole, I would need more disposable cash on hand (and probably a re-worked rig). Keyhole is expensive to install and it requires you find Eater (another expensive program). It's a good card, just not for this particular build. (As a note, I think you'd probably have to go up to 3 vigil with Keyhole. You definitely want the extra <span class=\"icon icon-mu\"><\/span>).<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Final Thoughts on the Deck<\/em>: I (probably) wouldn't take this to Regionals or Worlds. It's probably too susceptible to running into someone playing Crisium + Lotus Field (though you can win through that), and the slog might be too much over an enormous tournament. I feel that the deck is capitalizing to some extent on people not remembering Anatomy of Anarchy, and not knowing how to play against Reina. Still, strong piloting of the deck can yield wins even if you're not Siphoning over and over. The deck can win without Siphon, too (though it doesn't want to).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Uncle's Games, Bellevue, for putting on a great tournament, and for the players for being awesome! Gratz to Justin for his stellar piloting of Stealth Andy and NEH Grail to take second! (In the Lower Bracket Finals, I saw him come back from a 0-6 deficit against Leela and win!)<\/p>\n","username":"CJFM","cards":{"01002":3,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01010":2,"01011":2,"01012":2,"01014":1,"01018":3,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02021":1,"02022":3,"02065":3,"03054":2,"04041":1,"06033":2,"07032":3,"07036":3,"07039":1,"07040":3,"07047":2}},

{"identity":"images/Kate.png","id":23925,"name":"Congress","creation":"2015-07-20 16:01:44","description":"<p>This has been my tournament deck for most of this season and I want to publish it here in case anyone is looking for a good runner deck for nationals (which I'm not attending). In my opinion, this is the best deck I've ever built by a wide margin.<\/p>\n\n<p>I call this deck Congress because the goal is to get paid an ungodly sum of money for doing absolutely nothing. You work hard to get elected and then nobody expects you do to a damned thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of the deck is fairly straight forward: get a 6-credit-per-turn drip economy up as soon as possible and use that to counter any problem the corp tries to create. Use SMC + stimhack to be aggressive early, but only if you need to. This deck is so demoralizingly powerful in mid- and late-game that you can afford to let the corp get an agenda or two without too much worry that you'll lose the game. Even an astro scored early isn't a problem as long as you are doing ok on getting set up properly (clot will prevent them from using that counter anyway).<\/p>\n\n<p>Draw like a mad person early game. With 3 modded and 3 career fair you can afford to quality time on click 2 or diesel on click 3 and be fairly certain you won't be trashing or wasting cards. Additionally, drawing often makes the corp mistakenly think that you're struggling (even while you're looking at an SMC and stimhack in hand) and they'll feed you an agenda you can easily steal.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck has grown to 48 cards because of the utility I threw on top (sacrificial construct and 2 feedback filters). The second game I lost with this deck at a regional was to a PE deck and my local meta was starting to fill up with Batty kill decks and occasional jank Cybernetics decks so I made the change and have been very happy. I very commonly end up drawing and installing the last card of the deck, so the fact that I'm over the minimum deck size hasn't been a problem for me. Having 3 or 4 of my drip economy cards at the bottom of my pile sometimes happens, but this deck loses so infrequently that it hasn't been a problem I have felt needs addressing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to lose with this deck is by being too aggressive. People will think this deck is an aggro PPVP Kate (struggling to find its voice pads) and will realize too late that it's a hard control deck. While I didn't win any regionals I played in with this deck (missed top 8 by a strength of schedule cut because my 1st round opponent won the scorched earth prize and my corps did poorly every time), I did beat loads of good players with it including the eventual tournament champion in St. Louis.<\/p>\n\n<p>The key is to know your match ups and change your play style accordingly. Rely on clot against fastrobiotics (sac con can save it from a cyberdex purge), keep 4 cards in hand against butcher shop and run on any server with 2 cards in it (so they can't San San an installed Breaking News into a double scorch), and make Weyland score 7 points against you rather than letting them SEA Source you. Just breathe and have confidence that every long game is yours. While 2 of my losses were to NBN, they also represented an absolute majority of my 16 wins as well. The matchup is a favorable one.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've tried dozens of permutations to this deck and there are lots of ways to adjust the archetype to your personal style. I've had worse works almost as well as inject but gives some damage protection. I've experimented with a few day jobs and have loved them early game. Gordian blade works if you're not expecting many code gates (though study guide is surprisingly awesome. I'd highly highly recommend keeping it). I've even tried the supplier rather than career fair to some success (though I felt it was a bit too slow, even for this slower archetype).<\/p>\n\n<p>As always, questions and criticisms are welcome.<\/p>\n","username":"Daine","cards":{"01004":3,"01007":1,"01026":1,"01033":1,"01034":3,"01035":3,"01048":1,"02009":1,"02028":3,"02069":3,"02087":3,"02091":1,"02107":3,"03037":2,"03038":3,"03040":1,"03046":3,"03053":3,"06073":2,"07055":3,"08001":1,"08023":3,"08028":1}},

Stephen is a fantastic player, and is quite devoted to the Anarch faction.  He is also a fantastic deck builder, and a great guy. A true gem in the ANR community. <\/p>\n\n<p>We have been trying to get something to sing consistently, and Stephen came up with a build that he noted had been really doing well in his local meta lately.  Already having won a Regional, I was open to play anything, and asked if I could run it.  I really wanted something that hurt the top meta decks, primarily RP, and this deck seemed like it could really hurt RP. <\/p>\n\n<p>Man, did I underestimate it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Whizz went 8-1 in a 71 person Regional in Madison, WI.  I was shocked at the turnout, as the Wausau, WI Regional I won a few weeks prior, only 2.5 hours drive north of Madison, only drew 32 people.  The Chicago crue came out in force, and maybe Madison's more central location and the date worked for more people.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Swiss, Whizz faced 4 RP and 2 H-B, going 5-1.  The only loss was v. ETF, that Biotic'd out an ABT early for a Tollbooth\/Wall of Static\/Wall of Static.  :sadface:.  I was still able to get to score 2 Vitruvius, but couldn't keep up with the Biotics and ICE.  Otherwise, the Whizz destroyed the Asset-based econ of the rest of the decks, causing major issues.  RP was able to drop Celebrity Gifts, but that just allowed them to rez a few ICE, which were promptly melted away with Parasites.  The Whizz went 3-0 in Elims, winning 3 games in a row in the losers bracket to get to the Finals v. my sparring partner, Aaron Andries.  I already won a Regional, was starving, and didn't think the Whizz would hold up v. his Blue Sun, so the Gentlemen's Final gave him the win, and us dinner and drinks.<\/p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this deck is its simplicity.  It really feels like what the core of Netrunner is.  It's simple, strong econ and card draw, fueled by the Resources and Events.  The Breakers are pretty core Anarch, and D4V1D caused major problems all day.  The Clone Chips ensure that problem ICE dies quickly.  Parasite is an MVP, killing anything from Pups to Heimdalls all day.  The final addition was Net-Ready Eyes.  I wanted a card from the new pack in the deck, and this is an obvious add.  Wooley didn't want them in, so that's my major change from his deck:  -1 Atman, -1 Career Fair, +2 NRE.  I think they work so well with this Breaker suite that it's hard not to play, and being able to set up and play I've Had Worse for free off them is a fantastic bonus.  Visage is another great card, and is used almost every turn after the Baby arrives.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck plays pretty straight forward.  Keep drawing and setting up money.  Don't reveal Breakers until you're ready to go in.  Kill all Assets.  Melt all ICE on R&amp;D, and win with, as Mr. Wooley calls it, 'The Medium Race' (Hitler wouldn't approve).  Whizz's ability really shines there, as he can melt garbage out of R&amp;D, allowing follow-up Medium digs to go even farther.  Numerous times I would drop a second Medium for the finish.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though the deck can support 6 MUs, there were times I would have to overwrite something.  Would really love to get a Memstrips in here, to piss off @medioxcore, if anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck is a freakin' rock, and could even be used as a teaching deck, or win a Regional.

This results in shuffling the other\ntwo looked at cards into R&amp;D (they neve actually leave R&amp;D),\npreventing them from being installed or trashed.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Here's a breakdown for you:<\/p>\n\n<p>You score ABT - You look at all three cards - You install and rez one ice - You choose to use the Foundry - Your Foundry ability happens, your deck is shuffled, thus nothing happens to the rest of the cards. You can't install them, and they aren't trashed.<\/p>\n\n<h2><em>Going deeper:<\/em><\/h2>\n\n<ul><li>The main focus of this deck is strong and stable deck mathematics that emanates into strong and long-term effective board states that support key upgrades that raise you from the hell of being forced to otherwise bluff your way into victory against many decks. I've tried a lot of variants where my splash was burned up for tempo and cash, but after many tournaments I came to the decision that even though I could get insane tempo, a good runner having enough money to run at the right moments devastated me far too much.<\/li>\n<li>There are certain elements of the board state you need to be able to read at all times if possible. Pay special attention to these aspects of the game.\n\n<ul><li>Firstly, when to proc your foundry ability. Of course most of the time it's either forced, or just necessary to build up your board. But some times, you'll really need to really ponder, do you need the proc. Will it make you unnecessarily float cards in your hand? Will it make an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a> you are going to score soon unsafer? Will it unnecessarily thin your deck? Can you efficiently install the ice soon enough? Or can it help you draw your last agendas to score, even if you didn't need the ice draw itself? On the other side of things, even if you have to float, usually searching for your small NEXT ice is top priority in terms of your long-term plans. Regardless, you should always be aware of how many ice you still have in your deck and generally how many cards you still have in your deck, to maintain the stability of your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a>s.<\/li>\n<li>Secondly, when to install your upgrades. Due to having a lot of recursion, you'll be able to spam your upgrades even early and mid game without losing a lot of late game potential, but at the same time if you aren't careful you'll end up having stuff trashed or wasted unnecessarily.<\/li>\n<li>Thirdly, how to balance your icing. A common mistake people can make is overcommitting too much (which results in unnecessarily spending too much credits on installing), not knowing what central to protect (getting rekt by a well placed run event et cetera), or not realizing how to bait the runner getting more NEXT ice rezzed. Some times, you might want to leave a single ice in front of a central to get the runner to run, saving you both cash and giving you edge for your NEXT suite, both by their innate and your Foundry proc.<\/li>\n<li>As an extra thing to think about, you can really do some gamechanging plays with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02051\">Project Vitruvius<\/a> counters. Be creative, and witness the power of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06062\">Peak Efficiency<\/a> as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Take the time to keep your board state safe, you shouldn't be pushing out agendas all the time! You should usually use your main scoring server for your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01056\">Adonis Campaign<\/a>. <\/li>\n<\/ul><h2><em>Explaining card and splash choices:<\/em><\/h2>\n\n<ul><li>I chose <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06021\">The Foundry: Refining the Process<\/a> as my identity because it brings a lot of safety, speed and stability to my NEXT based board setup, gives us the safest <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a>s out there, and enables some really synergy rich plays such as going wild with with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06088\">Executive Boot Camp<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>s are there to tax and slow the runner more. That four credits can mean a lot.<\/li>\n<li>One-offs:\n\n<ul><li>I took a one-off of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04114\">Caprice Nisei<\/a> because (even though I feel like she could fit almost any deck) she brings a lot of extra kick for the influence and card slot, especially given we have a lot of recursion. I tried various builds, spending my leftover influence for cards like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07013\">Wormhole<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02056\">Pop-up Window<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04076\">Sweeps Week<\/a>, but in the end noticed that I literally get the most stable bang for my buck out of Caprice. It works whenever I draw it. I don't have to wait to try to get semi-expensive conditional benefits out of it. If I had the influence, I'd run more of it, but <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08074\">Marcus Batty<\/a> is even more important, due to it being a strong multi-use winning condition for me.<\/li>\n<li>I took one <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> because I had one open agenda slot, didn't want to shift my deck math for the worse with a 5\/3 or two 3\/1s (making it easier for the runner to win) and saw some good use in it. Since this deck is able to force agenda scoring with your upgrades or a good <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test<\/a>,  I decided to include this one-off \n<a href=\"\/en\/card\/02011\">Mandatory Upgrades<\/a> to give me some new outs for winning. I've tested a lot of different agendas for this last slot, up from fragments to Gila, but ended up with this.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a> is there as a finishing touch to resolve some tougher endgame situations. I doubt I have to explain its inclusion any more.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2><em>Match ups:<\/em><\/h2>\n\n<ul><li>Against both rush and control matchups, you need to keep slower pace and pay special attention to setting up your board as safely as possible, to minimize your losses from getting hit hard and remove risks of having a too slow recovery time after being hit too hard. If your ice is trashed, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04060\">Interns<\/a> is your best friend.<\/li>\n<li>In tempo and midrange matchups, try to get your opponent off their feet by doing a lot of plays that reaction and cost the runner momentum in some form. Against the best players, this is usually achieved with your upgrades and aggressively pushing out assents behind ice.<\/li>\n<li>Against the combo and turtle runners, don't forget that most of them can still make some reactive runs, so don't pop a wheelie with your agenda installs. Your role will most likely be that of a wannabe tempo deck.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2><em>Tips for beginners:<\/em><\/h2>\n\n<ul><li>Your main focus should be learning how to keep your board state safe and efficient, and calculating your decks mathematics a few turns ahead, especially if holding a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06062\">Peak Efficiency<\/a>, your ultimate recovery tool after your early game. I've seen people lending my decks do weird over-, and undercommitting,  to centrals, causing them to either slow their game pace down by a lot or losing to being barraged on an aspect of the board they've ignored.<\/li>\n<li>Remember that Ichi is a ghetto Gold for Marcus Batty. That could be of use.<\/li>\n<li>Until you learn this deck inside out and can analyze your hands by more than a few thumb rules, you should prioritize having the following in a good starting hand:\n\n<ul><li>An asset and\/or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01110\">Hedge Fund<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Two ice, unless both are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08011\">NEXT Gold<\/a>s, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01062\">Ichi 1.0<\/a>s and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08033\">Turing<\/a>s.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Avoid too many agendas in your starting hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>All in all, I hope you like this deck! I've put an immense amount of effort into the Foundry, and it has really paid off, at least in terms of the number of Netrunner playmats I own . :D I really love teching identities I enjoy to create new competitive builds, it's probably the biggest joy I get out of Netrunner.

It went completely undefeated in Swiss and bracket. I was and still am completely blown away by the sheer power of the deck. Never once in a list of Blue Sun IT Dept, HB:EtF, NEH Butcher\/Fastro, and TWiY Psycho did I ever feel out of control or threatened, and that's a list of Corps whose mention gives me the scares with any other Runner. <\/p>\n\n<p>Street Peddler and Faust thrust Noiseshop into the stratosphere of Tier 0, and that's my intention of describing in this writeup. Taking a hand with Wyldside, Aesops, or Peddler immediately puts the tempo in your hands, and it's a big deal when Daily Casts was easily the worst card in the deck. The tactical strategy of rezzing impactful ICE against Noise goes out the window with a Peddler out, and Faust further amplifies the power by providing insane use to the 7+ dead draws. Lotus Field went from MVP versus Noise to waste of 5 credits. Architects are no longer a problem and only a two-card\/credit nuisance, and it's always possible to just get in if you really need to.<\/p>\n\n<p>This allows the Noise penultimate strategy of checking remotes, plundering HQ with Imp, and playing Viruses to be literally unstoppable between Datasucker, Parasite, d4v1d, and Faust. These guidelines were followed in every game of the day and neither faction, ICE, nor kill threat stopped the machine. Only one Medium dig was performed, the remaining wins were wrestled from HQ, supposedly safe remotes, or Archives. <\/p>\n\n<p>I can't emphasize enough how strong this deck felt and played.<\/p>\n\n<p>Big shoutout to the Austin crew and the greater southern Netrunner meta - we will get our ANRPC soon, believe it.

Over the weekend it went 10 - 4, going 6 - 0 in the LCQ and 4 - 4 in the finals. The difference is partly because the standard was much higher in the finals (of course), and partly because the meta in the finals was different (much more Astrobiotics).<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea is fairly obvious - using eater for cheap breaking you can derez the ice with Crescentus (drawing a card), and clone chip the crescentus back (drawing a card. This is most powerful against bioroid ice, as you can click through those to break the subroutines allowing the denial to start much earlier. On top of this, you also have Siphons to keep the corp down, and Same Old Thing to recur them, and Emergency Shutdown to hit rezzed ice elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Muertos gang member is incredibly powerful in played right, especially in a deck like this that has a lot of support for it (notably fall guy for protection). More than one Tollbooth was derezzed from it, and its effect makes you practically unkillable also. Keyhole is a finishing piece more than an integral part - with eater you can often struggle for accesses but Keyhole can still give you something productive to do with your clicks<\/p>\n\n<p>In terms of matchups, Astrobiotics is the worst. Being able to score out from 0 credits with an Astro token and Shipment from SanSan is a pain, as well as the fact that a lot of their ice is cheap (making derez less powerful) and awkward (such as wraparound). I would in future consider swapping breach for aurora, because it's main function is breaking wraparound and they're both equally inefficient at that. Not being able to access a wraparound remote cost me a game against an ETF rush deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other troublsome ice are Swordsman and Turing. Swordsman at least dies to parasite, if you've found it yet, and otherwise can be derezzed via faerie &amp; crescentus if nothing else. Turing on a central needs to be parasited really, though on R&amp;D it can be left for a while if you can shut it down. Turing on a remote has to be shut down, and then the corp kept poor enough for rezzing it to be a problem. However, the fact that ETF often relies on Bioroid ice (which is very vulnerable to both siphon and Crescentus) and also rarely packs ice costing 2 or less means that this normally isn't too hard to achieve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kill decks, especially Butchershop, are completely trivial. Being able to draw on the corp's turn makes you nigh unkillable. and Crash Space is as good as plassy at keeping you alive out of Geist, as well as having other utility. Fall Guy makes it much harder for a corp to trash it post-midseasons also, so this is a fantastic matchup. Many Jinteki kill decks are light on econ, so they also fall over to corp-turn draw and econ denial.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of the games that this deck lost, 3 were to Astrobiotics (weekend record was 2 - 3 vs Astrobiotics), though 2 of those were to Tim (2015 UK Nats runner up), who not only went on to win the event, but also had the advantage of playing against this whilst I was testing it locally. The other loss was to evilgaz, 2015 Nordics Nationals champion, who was playing an ETF with Wraparound splashed. Wins included games against the previously mentioned astrobiotics, ETF (both SanSan and Caprice versions), Biotech (both rush and kill) , and Butchershop.<\/p>\n\n<p>There were games of this both on the livestream for the event, and also recorded, and if I remember (or people remind me to) I will post links to these in the comments.<\/p>\n","username":"mendax","cards":{"01012":1,"01018":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01030":2,"01050":3,"02043":3,"02065":3,"02104":3,"03038":3,"03054":3,"04009":3,"04061":1,"04106":2,"05042":1,"05048":3,"06059":1,"07040":1,"08063":1,"08068":3}},

The basic plan is:<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson + Diagnostics + Shutdown into scored Hades Fragment, pass turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>You have a full archives but if the Runner goes in they give you money, take tags, and you can score out with the help of Hades for the win.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can win out of hand (without a preinstalled Jackson), ending up with two Jacksons exiled. First Diagnostics is Interns (JHow), Reclamation Order (Diagnostics) and Biotic. Second Diagnostics is Interns (Hades), Shipment x2.

A boring old professor, nose to the grindstone, digging through that deck till he can get his decrepit rig up and ready to score, then trying to take the lead back in the endgame just as time runs out; an inevitable metaphor for the pointlessness of life. Man, toss that idea right out the window.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>[RECORD SCRATCH]<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re gonna win this game by throwing the biggest party any weird old man ever threw.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>[James Brown's \"I FEEL GOOD\" starts to play in the background]<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Party Place<\/strong><br \/>\nStrip down to your underwear, throw on some shades, and start dialing numbers. Your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08022\">Off-Campus Apartment<\/a> is where the magic happens. You have 18 friends coming over, and every time one of them rings the bell, they invite someone else. This card is gonna draw half your deck for you! If only you could afford the third copy. But FFG wisely cramped Iain\u2019s style at 10 influence. Oh well.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Party People<\/strong><br \/>\nDude, we don\u2019t have TIME to go over everyone you\u2019re inviting! But let\u2019s point out a couple of the real high-end attendees, the people who are gonna put this party on the <em>MAP<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p>First off,  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06056\">The Supplier<\/a>. You need to get in touch with this guy as soon as possible. He\u2019ll basically be handling your invites for you, letting people into the Apartment every turn for $2 off the cover charge. Mulligan your starting hand if you don\u2019t have either him, the Apartment, or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04004\">Hostage<\/a> to grab him with. You simply will not believe how fast this combination burns through your deck.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02008\">The Helpful AI<\/a> and his <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02069\">Underworld Contact<\/a>s. Once you have a couple of these guys show up, the dough really starts to trickle in. Don't be afraid to Hostage for the other half once you get one into your hand (assuming you have The Supplier in play, natch). This is half of your economy. Ideally, once this stuff is out (and it will happen virtually every game, believe me), you\u2019re making $5\/turn, saving $2\/turn on a free install, and getting a free draw off that install. And that's all before you wake up and take a shower for your first click.<\/p>\n\n<p>But don\u2019t stop there, broaden that social circle.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/08086\">Film Critic<\/a>. Yeah, everybody loves her, and for good reason. But in this deck, she doesn't just help you avoid Corporate troubles, she keeps your own friends feeling good. If you invite her, you don\u2019t have to worry about playing by <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03055\">The Source<\/a>'s rules any more (but the Corp still does). She also means that your deal with the NAPD won\u2019t go south, and that opens up some possibilities...<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Party Problem<\/strong><br \/>\nSo everyone\u2019s having a great time till there\u2019s a knock at the door, and it turns out they\u2019re NOT strippers, they\u2019re real cops. What to do? Pay em, that\u2019s what. Get a deal going with the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02109\">New Angeles City Hall<\/a>. That way when you <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>, you can just make a quick donation and be on your way. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01082\">Breaking News<\/a> got you down? Not anymore, have the NAPD put a lock on that footage for ya. And don\u2019t worry, as long as your <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08086\">Film Critic<\/a>\u2019s just \u201cadding those agendas to your scoring area\u201d rather than actually scoring them, City Hall doesn\u2019t seem to care. Legal loopholes, huh?<\/p>\n\n<p>And hell, now that we\u2019re not worried about tags, I think we can invite <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06060\">Rachel Beckman<\/a>. Give her a call once the NACH deal is in place if you need a fifth click to recover from all that early-morning partying you're doing.<\/p>\n\n<p>And of course, just in case something unexpected happens, invite a few <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04106\">Fall Guy<\/a>s. You can always kick them out if somebody important down at the station gets their panties in a twist.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Party Pooper<\/strong><br \/>\nSo everything seems like magic, right? I mean, you can\u2019t be tagged, you\u2019re making $7 a turn without any effort, you have 5 clicks, it takes the Corp an extra advancement to score anything, and half the time when you play a card you get to draw for free. What\u2019s the downside?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, the honest truth is, the deck\u2019s only weakness so far has been real life.\nSince Film Critic\u2019s release, I\u2019ve gone 51-2 with this deck at the time of this writing (losing once to a misplay which cost me my <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01025\">Aurora<\/a> - making barriers impassable, and once to <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08092\">Haarpsichord<\/a>, described in more detail below).<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem is, none of those games were timed, and <strong>every tournament match is<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As much as I\u2019ve played this deck now, a game still takes at least 45 minutes. I\u2019d put my Iain up against ANYTHING out there right now and bet on it to win, but it just won\u2019t make hay in a tournament format. So I\u2019ve posted it here for people to enjoy casually, and I guess in hopes that someone will have the balls to try it in timed, and let me know how it does. Maybe someone else with lightning-fast judgement will be able to get it down to a playable time-frame. I just don\u2019t think that, even if I took the fastest-playing Corp possible, I\u2019d be able to get both sides in. (And this deck is ALWAYS playing at a point deficit, so timeout is not your friend.)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>General Strategy<\/strong><br \/>\nObviously, you can\u2019t lose resources or programs that are necessary, because you don\u2019t have any way to get them back. Even when you know this, you can make mistakes. I drew on click 4 vs PE and then took a net damage, losing Aurora. Once my <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> counters were gone, that was it. My other loss (Haarpsichord) was due to having a Breaking News go off while NACH was on my Supplier. Bye-bye tag protection, and all because I wanted to save a buck on installing NACH. Don\u2019t be greedy. Draw on your first (and second if need be) click, then install anything that you can\u2019t afford to lose (your programs, your NACH, your Film Critic, your Source, and to some degree, your Helpful AI).<\/p>\n\n<p>Second, you have a lot of silver bullets in here. Luckily you can tutor for most of them with Hostage. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05037\">Logos<\/a> will let you find the rest. Prioritizing what you tutor for will make or break your play. Know what the correct \u201canswer\u201d to the deck type you are playing is, and get it out as soon as you can. It stands to reason that in some games you just won\u2019t find what you need, but in my 53 recorded plays, it hasn\u2019t been the reason I\u2019ve lost yet. Iain always has a trick up his sleeve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have played cards to the table, get your redundant systems in place to protect them (Fall Guy, and to a lesser extent, Decoy). Sometimes you simply HAVE to steal two agendas in a turn (the horror!)<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Biotic or Astro<\/strong> rush decks, wait until one agenda is scored, then get the Source and a Fall Guy out as fast as you can. Don\u2019t be afraid of rush, really. It\u2019s not a hard matchup. Source hurts the Corp WAY more than you think she does as long as you can keep her in play (versus a rush deck, you will probably want to save ALL THREE Fall guys to protect her if at all possible). Rush decks are usually woefully unprepared to protect against a sustained economy on this scale. You will have far more money than you need to get into servers, and you can trash SanSans (and other assets) where you find them with abandon. Don\u2019t freak, keep your cool, be ready to run earlier than you\u2019d like. Your apartment won't be as full as it gets most games, but you\u2019ll win without too much trouble.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Butchershop and Haarpsichord<\/strong> are a different story. NACH is the all-star here, but you can\u2019t tutor for it until they score (Logos), so be careful what is installed. Remember that Breaking News can hurt you really bad if you have an Apartment with 10 connections on it and no Fall Guy. Play it safe, let them score, get NACH. Once you do, you should always have enough money on hand to avoid any tags they can put on you, and Breaking News stops being scary. Film Critic makes Midseasons a non-issue.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Tag-and-Bag \/ Argus<\/strong> tend to be easy, since Film Critic hard counters Argus and Punative Counterstrike. You should usually win credit contests (Vamp and Siphon to swing the balance) if they are neccessary. NACH will protect you against a SEA Source or Posted Bounty, but again, you have to get it into play. Fall Guys and Decoys fill in the gap until you see it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>RP<\/strong> is a boring-ass slog of a matchup. You both want the game to last forever and will each be playing solitaire for a long time. Fortunately, you can make a LOT more money than RP can, so you will completely ignore his remote server till late game, and apply pressure on his HQ (dont waste Overmind counters though). When he makes a late-game move on what seems like a scoring window, take an assload of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati<\/a> money (or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05031\">Call in some Favors<\/a> for 15 credits) and Vamp the motherfucker. Ash and Caprice won't do anything if they don't see a paycheck. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03054\">Same Old Thing<\/a> him when he tries it again. You can sometimes suck the coffers dry a third time with a Siphon or two if you\u2019ve had really bad luck with the centrals. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PE<\/strong> is a surprisingly stressful matchup, because the course of regular play means you will be taking damage at unexpected times, and that can ruin you if you don't watch out. NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR HAND THAT WILL WRECK YOU PERMANENTLY IF YOU LOSE IT. You can't get it back. That means your programs must be played the instant you find them in your hand. Yes, this will lead to inefficiency and a loss of surprise, and it really sucks for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01026\">Femme<\/a> but it\u2019s virtually mandatory. If you lose NACH, it\u2019s not the end of the world here, just don\u2019t plan to play Rachel this game, and leave yourself enough clicks to work off the Siphon and Vamp tags. Remember that Film Critic protects you when you steal, and hoard those hit points for the thousand cuts you can't avoid. Iain wants to play most of his deck, so there will definitely be hard choices to make about what to play and what to hold.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Glacier<\/strong> is probably the worst matchup, because if they can get enough big ICE in front of their servers, you will deplete even Iain's astounding cash reserves running every turn. Try to keep them as poor as possible (Vamp or Siphon at opportune times) early game so their options are limited. They may just turtle up and earn as much money as they can, so don't waste your credits on runs that won't end in points. Remember that they're the one on a timer; you can wait until kingdom come for them to put something out that you can steal. You may end up just having to let them mill themselves to death, rather than getting into a position where you have no money and they have a scoring window.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Changes?<\/strong>\nI just finished testing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02086\">Pheromones<\/a> in what had been the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01023\">Lemuria Codecracker<\/a> slot. They're both reasonable choices (surprisingly), but <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01028\">Sneakdoor Beta<\/a> is currently testing in that slot, and so far I find it to be superior. Play it on click one late-game, after Overmind is useless. Then run for 12 HQ accesses. Nobody expects this kindly old gentleman to try the backdoor.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm also thinking a second NACH might be a reasonable slot, just for consistency. I would be happy to hear other suggestions.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Note: Always perform your best Drunk Ian McKellan impression while piloting this deck.<\/strong><\/p>\n","username":"CapAp","cards":{"01018":2,"01025":1,"01026":1,"01028":1,"01031":1,"01032":2,"02006":1,"02008":1,"02021":1,"02024":2,"02069":3,"02085":2,"02091":1,"02105":1,"02109":1,"03054":1,"03055":1,"04004":3,"04009":1,"04106":3,"05028":1,"05031":3,"05037":2,"05050":1,"05053":2,"06056":3,"06060":1,"08022":2,"08086":1}},
{"identity":"images/Tita.png","id":24824,"name":"Fascism- \"Three\" Ways to Win","creation":"2015-08-13 03:53:04","description":"<p>This is an original deck I somehow conjured up in my mind a few weeks ago for my beloved Weyland when the spoilers for Old Hollywood came out. I threw it together with some proxies and, WOW, I've been having the time of my life! <\/p>\n\n<p>This deck, which I've dubbed \"Fascism\" because you're going to be conquering the Military-Industrial Complex through the support of the people and the media! And weapons of mass destruction. It has been performing tremendously well over the last couple weeks, both in person and online. It's a heart-pounding wild ride which I've had a ton of fun building and piloting, and it's been doing great!<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, my idea was to have \"three\" ways to win, or at least, have two different focuses for scoring-\n1. Score out  <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Atlas<\/a> to search for more <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02018\">Atlas<\/a>  or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01094\">Hostile Takeover<\/a>. \n2. Score out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07006\">Government Takeover<\/a> partnered with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08097\"> Hollywood Grid<\/a>. \n3. Double <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01099\">Scorched<\/a> with a cherry on top!<\/p>\n\n<p>I chose Titan for these strategies due to the higher influence and the synergy with the Atlas-train, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07007\">High-Risk Investment<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01094\">Hostile Takeover<\/a> + <a href=\"\/en\/card\/07009\">Mark Yale<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The MVPs of this deck are <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08117\">Public Support<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08097\">Old Hollywood Grid<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08089\">Terminator<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/08117\">Public Support<\/a> is an AMAZING card. It's extra points for you, points the Runner can't get, and it wastes them 4 credits and the run to trash it. Many of the people I've played against just leave it, which spells them DOOM due to my friends <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08089\">Terminat-er-Enforcer<\/a>. If you're kicking off an Atlas-train, it also helps you win faster. Great card.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/08097\">Old Hollywood Grid<\/a> is really fun in this deck. Government Takeover, High-Risk Investment, and Oaktown can't be stolen without them trashing this first... and after running through an Archer and a Terminator, they probably don't have the cash. I throw this in my scoring server and R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/06010\">Mother Goddess<\/a> is just so wonderful. One game, I installed this and Government Takeover into a server turn one. Runner couldn't get in. I had advanced Takeover enough so that I would win next turn, but I also had Punitives and Scorched in hand, so I win either way. Having the multiple win conditions in this deck is really, really fun! (Yes, I know. Dies to Parasite. Dies to Lightning Bolt. Yadayadayadayada so does everything else.) I LOVE IT.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/08089\">Enforcer 1.0<\/a>- THE TERMINATOR- is underrated. The brain damage and program trash really helps, and killing Desperado is always great. Nearly everyone I've played against has been surprised and subsequently wrecked by his inclusion.<\/p>\n\n<p>ICE mix is up to the user, these are just my personal favorites. 1x Searchlight because advancing it once makes it a nice tax or die.<\/p>\n\n<p>So yeah. It's been doing great. You can score Government Takeover or the other agendas safely and consistently, or blow them up other wise. <\/p>\n\n<p>I'm very proud to have created a successful and unique deck AND have a ton of fun with it, and my opponents have been blown away by the deck's ingenuity and different approach to Big W. <\/p>\n\n<p>Give it a try!<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit: After feedback, I totally blanked on Geothermal Fracking- swap out Oaktown and put in Fracking. It's a great improvement.

{"identity":"images/Chronos.png","id":26049,"name":"Barrier Bay","creation":"2015-09-08 17:02:21","description":"<p>Barrier Bay is program destruction taken to its logical extreme. Let\u2019s trash their corroder (or AI breaker) Blacklist it and remove it from the game. We are going to attack the runner\u2019s programs everywhere we can. We will use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04073\">Shock!<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01072\">Neural EMP<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08111\">Chronos Protocol: Selective Mind-mapping<\/a> ability to snipe programs and program recursion from the runners hand before they have a chance to play them. We will use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08074\">Marcus Batty<\/a> to attack programs already installed. And we will use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08036\">Blacklist<\/a> to prevent them from coming back while we try to score a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06049\">Chronos Project<\/a> to remove them for good.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss the card choices I made while building Barrier Bay. Barrier Bay is looking to kill fracters specifically. I am sure you could build the deck to go after decoders, but the most popular fracters are cheaper than the most popular decoders and killers making <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a> strongest against fracters, so we kill the fracters. <\/p>\n\n<p>To make trashing fracters our win condition we are playing 8 cheap barriers <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01113\">Wall of Static<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03026\">Bastion<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04013\">Himitsu-Bako<\/a>. We are playing the cheapest barriers available to us because if all goes according to plan the runner will not have the breaker they need, but we are not playing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04059\">Paper Wall<\/a> because our barriers will get broken at some point. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a> would be a good splash here since it is cheap and strong vs AI, but we are influence starved. We also need some program trashing to get rid of the programs that the runner has put in play. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a> is the obvious choice. It\u2019s only one influence cheap to rez at 4, but it has strength 0 so if playing against a deck with parasite especially mid run parasite becareful using it. The only other trashing ice I have included is a one of Archer. I have experimented with replacing this with a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a> and another <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a> I find myself missing the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a>. Sometimes in game with this deck rezzing an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a> can just win the game; along with the 6 one point agendas makes it a really good fit. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04033\">Swordsman<\/a> does double duty trashing AI\u2019s and triggering the decks ability. The fact that it is also a credit cheaper than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01077\">Neural Katana<\/a> is just a bonus. I\u2019ve tried out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04056\">Snoop<\/a> but the influence is better spent on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a> and the ice is a huge money sink that the decks economy cannot support.<\/p>\n\n<p>Barrier Bay\u2019s Operations serve only 2 purposes to get money and to remove programs. 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01072\">Neural EMP<\/a>\u2019s and 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a>s take care of the latter. The only strange choice here is that I am playing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05014\">Medical Research Fundraiser<\/a> over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04012\">Celebrity Gift<\/a>. The two reasons for this is that one I am trying to keep the program destruction strategy quiet during the early stages of the game, and two if the deck is functioning properly it doesn\u2019t matter how much money the runner has if they don\u2019t have a breaker to spend it on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Both of the upgrades in the deck are tools to remove in play programs. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08074\">Marcus Batty<\/a> should be combined with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archer<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01064\">Rototurret<\/a> to trash a program. Remember that if the runner has clone chips installed they still get a chance to bring their programs back (unless you have a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08036\">Blacklist<\/a>). <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a> isn\u2019t exactly program trashing, but for decks that don\u2019t have a search card it might as well be. <\/p>\n\n<p>The assets start off with 3 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson Howard<\/a> because we are playing the Corp, but in all seriousness they are very important to the deck since you will be dumping cards in archives with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a>. We are playing 2 <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08036\">Blacklist<\/a> because you can\u2019t always score a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06049\">Chronos Project<\/a> when you need to, and laying down a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08036\">Blacklist<\/a> is a lot easier. We are playing <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04073\">Shock!<\/a> over <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snare!<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05011\">Shi.Ky\u016b<\/a> because it works from archives and we will be dumping cards there with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a> and it doesn\u2019t drain our credits. \nOur agenda selection is also somewhat out of the ordinary. We are playing 21 points when we could easily play 20 and leave ourselves less open to the runner stealing agendas. However <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06049\">Chronos Project<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> are so important to the game plan of the deck I feel it is worth the risk. Playing 6 one point agendas is rough so we need to get that count down or we will end up with 16 agendas, so we are playing 3 copies of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05007\">The Future Perfect<\/a> (it\u2019s a big agenda and it protects itself). The last six points were a tough choice. I had originally had <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a> here but the issue is we don\u2019t really tax the runner and in a lot of games they are just floating on a lot of worthless credits and will happily spend them for 2 points. I think <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02032\">Fetal AI<\/a> is better since it still protects itself in the early game and it can trigger <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08111\">Chronos Protocol: Selective Mind-mapping<\/a>\u2019s ability.<\/p>\n\n<p>OK so we have our game plan, but how does the deck actually play? The thing to keep in mind is that this is a control deck. The goal is to very specifically control where the runner can go to create scoring windows for our agendas. <\/p>\n\n<p>One of the things about this deck that is not completely obvious is that you are aware of the cards in the runners hand for a large portion of game (so long as they are running.) This allows you to make plays that might seem risky but aren\u2019t. For example you have a criminal player that you hit with net damage during their turn (from a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05004\">House of Knives<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04033\">Swordsman<\/a>) you see no barrier breaker and no inside job. It\u2019s fairly safe to score behind a barrier this turn. It is also OK to give away an agenda if you can trade it for a program. Let\u2019s say they have corroder in play could lay down a barrier <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a> and a one point agenda. This is a win win. If they run they score one point and the corroder goes to the bottom of the deck. If they don\u2019t run you score one of your powerful one pointer agendas.<\/p>\n\n<p>While I consider the deck to be very strong it does have weak points and bad matchups. First this is a control deck you need to be in control of the game at all times. If it starts to run away from you it will likely continue to do so. Mass recursion is a problem. If you can\u2019t get a protected <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08036\">Blacklist<\/a> up or score a well-timed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06049\">Chronos Project<\/a> against a Test Run Scavenge Shaper it is going to be a rough game. Economy attack can also give the deck fits. Specifically Vamp. Being repeatedly Account Siphoned is an issue for almost any crop, but Vamp is a serious problem since you don\u2019t really tax the runner they can sit on large stacks of cash in the late game and easily vamp you down to nothing. And lastly big R&amp;D digs off of Medium or multiple R&amp;D Interfaces can be problematic. When the runner has their breakers installed you rely on <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04058\">Power Shutdown<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08074\">Marcus Batty<\/a> to bail you out. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/08074\">Marcus Batty<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06032\">Will-o'-the-Wisp<\/a> have a trash cost of 1, so they will almost always be trashed when accessed.<\/p>\n\n<p>I welcome comments and critiques on the deck. I have a couple more decks that I can do the long form write up for and I look forward to being engaged in this community.<\/p>\n","username":"HopelessHeretic","cards":{"01064":2,"01072":3,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01113":3,"02032":3,"03026":2,"04012":1,"04013":3,"04015":3,"04033":2,"04058":3,"04073":2,"05004":3,"05007":3,"05014":3,"06032":2,"06049":3,"08036":2,"08074":2,"08111":1}},

Valencia Blackmail recursion decks definitely had their moment to shine, but people quickly learned that no matter how much recursion the Valencia player has, you can run them out of it, and that there are cards (specifically Elizabeth Mills, Executive Boot Camp, and Accelerated Beta Test) which can make Valencia a sad girl.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, when I saw the spoiler for DDoS, I thought to myself \u201cOh, this card can\u2019t be real.  Inside Job every server for the entire turn, and you can pre-load it so it doesn\u2019t even cost you a click on the turn you use it?  Surely that can\u2019t be real\u201d.  But it is real, they printed it, and when you combine it with the previously Folder Fodder card False Echo, it can do really, really disgusting things.<\/p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY THIS DECK:<\/p>\n\n<p>Mulligan into some kind of Resource based econ and start building up credits while installing Same Old Things, Clone Chips, Imps, and the like.  Make sure you draw at least 2 cards per turn \u2013 you have a big deck, and you want to hit your key cards ASAP.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the Corp should arrogantly decide that they are going to install agendas in remotes, be sure to point out to them that Blackmail is a good card which means they shouldn\u2019t do that.  Install Plascretes and Film Critic when you find it because nothing loses you the game harder than being dead.  You don\u2019t need your money for breakers, so why not spend it on protecting yourself instead?<\/p>\n\n<p>Find yourself a DDoS, a False Echo, and some Clone Chips.  Install a couple of Mediums or a Keyhole.  Play an Amped Up, or two, pop your DDoS, and run at their unrezzed R&amp;D ICE.  Fly past the first piece of ICE they can\u2019t rez, trash False Echo to bounce it into their hand (because they can\u2019t choose to rez it because of DDoS).  The next piece of ICE is now the outermost, and DDoS says it can\u2019t be rezzed.  Clone Chip back a False Echo and bounce that if necessary.  Repeat until they have 1 unrezzed ICE on R&amp;D.  Keyhole or Medium it as many times as you have clicks or you need to in order to win.  If that doesn\u2019t win you the game, use D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, Same Old Thing, and Clone Chips to set up and do it again.  Repeat until victorious.<\/p>\n\n<p>CARD CHOICES AND MATCHUPS:<\/p>\n\n<p>Seriously, install your Plascretes.  Not having to worry about economic advantage against deck that wants to make you go boom is well worth it.  When you take 5 points out of R&amp;D on a sequence of Medium digs, Punitive can make you a sad panda.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you think your opponent has a bunch of Snares, go for Keyhole over the Mediums.  <\/p>\n\n<p>There are 3 \u2018traditional\u2019 ICEbreakers in this list because I am a coward.  Another approach is to drop those for an Eater, a Mimic and an Earthrise Hotel (which was the original list before I wussed out on the day) and switch to Eater\/Keyhole if they manage to get ICE rezzed on R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blacklist is a bummer.  If you suspect or see Blacklists, make sure to hang on to a Blackmail so you can get in and give it the business on the turn where you want to go digging.

{"identity":"images/Leela.png","id":26903,"name":"Vendetta (DLR Siphon Control for Worlds)","creation":"2015-09-28 18:20:56","description":"<p>This is the 45 I would be taking as runner to Worlds if I'd managed to get a ticket.<\/p>\n\n<p>I promised you this deck was a monster. Well, that was back in the beta version. The above is the full beast. It's the deck I use when I'm in a bad mood on OCTGN and need an easy win and self-esteem boost, because I'm still undefeated with it, and many of the victories have been sickeningly easy. (Hence the new deck name. When you're being a dick, go full dick.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me be perfectly clear: Leela is the best ID for the DLR deck, hands down. Sure, Hayley is a bit faster, and Valencia has a bit more reach, and Andy is a bit more consistent, but Leela cripples the corp from the get-go by forcing them to either play around her ability or accept that they may just have to leave a server unprotected in order to score an agenda. Thus, the corp's gameplan is constantly defined by Account Siphon to their detriment - either they run straight into it, or they give you enough time to set up the thin breaker suite required to land it anyway, while still letting you freely set up a combo that promises to end the game entirely in half a dozen turns. The instant the corp lets their guard down, you take all their money and force them to try to stop you while beaten into the dirt.<\/p>\n\n<p>But it's the other, less tangible advantages Leela offers that are almost as valuable and underappreciated. For example, any agendas Leela mills become an instant threat of tempo loss. Say the Corp tries going for a 5\/3 in an impervious scoring server and leaves you free to combo off, trying to race. Well, if any agendas land in archives, suddenly the corp has lost an entire turn of tempo and money, along with a chunk of their deck. There have even been games where I've willfully trashed a Hades Shard early for just a single agenda (or single extra mill off DLR) knowing the odds were excellent for me to score an agenda and tip the table over on my opponent.<\/p>\n\n<p>And while Leela doesn't have Joshua B, Criminal has a better card that also fills one of the deck's critical holes against certain strategies in Fisk Investment Seminar. Not only does Fisk speed up the milling of your opponent almost as much as a Josh will, while still netting you free cards to boot, Fisk lets you win the game through a scored Hades Fragment, where normal combo decks would otherwise be frozen out as the corp perpetually cycled one card back into their deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two major breakthroughs from the previous version of the deck were the Honor and Profit central suite, which on top of Eater ensures you can set up the critical Siphons without wasting influence (and thus letting you play Diesel, which in turn lets you conserve critical early-game cash), and Mr. Li, who takes the deck into overdrive while also offering a critical ninth target for Career Fair. The amount of free effective clicks Mr. Li offers to combo decks like this, where much of the deck ultimately becomes chaff to be sifted out, is grotesque.<\/p>\n\n<p>But the most important thing to take away from the deck is that, for all its combo pieces, it still has all the tools necessary to play a regular, albeit somewhat diminished, Criminal game. Steal money, steal tempo, pound centrals, access the agendas they can't score, steal more tempo, repeat until dead. That, I think, is what really separates the above list from other combo decks. For all the glint on the fine killing machine, what really sets this gun apart is the figurative bayonet at the end - because if all else fails, sometimes, you just gotta stab a guy (or, in this case, Siphon him to death and lock down R&amp;D until he submits).<\/p>\n\n<p>This is not a nice deck; this is not a deck I'd bring to a GNK. But I promise you, this is a deck that you should play at Worlds.<\/p>\n","username":"greyfield","cards":{"01002":1,"01018":3,"01021":1,"01022":1,"01034":3,"01050":3,"02103":3,"02105":2,"03053":3,"03054":3,"04106":3,"05041":1,"05042":1,"05046":1,"06059":1,"06095":1,"06120":3,"07040":1,"08023":3,"08087":2,"08105":3,"08108":3}}

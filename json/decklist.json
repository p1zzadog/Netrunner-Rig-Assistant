I turned to HB for a glacier approach, with most of my games ending with a tower of ICEs on a single server, sometimes up to 5 cards of different subtypes (avoiding more than two Code Gates, because of <a href=\"en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade's<\/a> ability keeping its strength). A Code Gate plus a couple of Barriers and maaaybe a Sentry somewhere in the fort, worked best. I usually avoid sentries in the beginning because they lack ETR and the runner usually runs naked in the beginning. I could lay them there as investment but what about <a href=\"en\/card\/01020\">Forged Activation Orders<\/a>? They destroy the element of surprise mid-game. Long story short, my deck was packed with ICE and economy, Adonis, Melange, PADs, Beanstalks, Hedge Funds. Nothing else, no traps, no tagging, not even upgrades.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything was going better against my Netrunner buddy as I started winning more often, until I found some new players to test the deck and lost miserably. One day I lost at 11-0 agenda points at a single game, when one guy run into R&amp;D with <a href=\"en\/card\/01036\">The Maker's Eye<\/a> and found two 3p agendas!! These runners were attacking aggressively every turn and I finally learned how much can <a href=\"en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a> hurt. Like a big guy kicking you right on the balls and then going retard, just so he can kick you again next round going full retard with another Stimhack. And then I remembered Jinteki...Good old punishing Jinteki, net-hurting those f***ing runners.<\/p>\n\n<p>I went home crying like a little bitch just to prepare for revenge. I packed my deck with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01070\">Snares<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01076\">Data Mines<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01075\">Chums<\/a>...and guess what, it worked like a charm. After the runner stimhacked a remote server packed with ICE just to stumble upon an installed Snare...oh man, bitch got her revenge and tasted some run-tears.<\/p>\n\n<p>I revised the deck a few times since that game, because I was only carrying the min 45 cards and got agenda flood multiple games resulting in a 50-50 win. In a few occasions I was forced to play shell game just to get rid of a few agendas from HQ, like installing an open agenda and a trap under ICE and it worked. Then I took it even further as to install two agendas out of hand advancing both of them next turn. The runner stole the one and got scared to check the other. I left it there double-advanced for many turns , managed to score another and came back to it to finish the game. Boy, that was fun.<\/p>\n\n<p>Long story short, this deck can be played both glacier or shell, depending on opening hand. As far as revisions go, I ditched the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01076\">Data Mines<\/a> for some <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">Project Junebugs<\/a> since this deck isn't primarily focused on net-damaging the runner and one point net damage can't hurt much, but a triple advanced <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">PJ<\/a> can destroy him, even a double adv. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01069\">PJ<\/a> can set the runner far behind. I wasn't sure about <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01057\">Aggressive Secretaries<\/a> either, going back and forth on removing them. At the end I kept them in deck to help with Agenda flood. I also included <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">Archived Memories<\/a> to recycle either the traps or the economy and ditched <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01101\">Archers<\/a> for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01090\">Tollbooths<\/a>. I couldn't wait for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">Priority Requisition<\/a> to rez an Archer and Tollbooth is a great alternative for keeping the runner poor without having to forfeit agendas or hoping on scoring a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">PR<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">AM<\/a> also saved me a few times from <a href=\"en\/card\/01001\">Noise's<\/a> ability, trashing an agenda.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for agendas in general, don't use <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">Accelerated Beta Test's<\/a> feature...it sucks! Unless you see your deck thin and not much ICE on the table, then maaaaybe you'll get lucky and find ICE on the top 3 cards of R&amp;D. Otherwise you'll end up with one cheap-ass ICE just discovered, rezzed over the Archives because the other two cards were agendas, or even end up with 2 agendas and an econ. card discarded just like that...with no protection whatsoever and your deck 3 cards thinner. And who's gonna save you? Only <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01058\">AM<\/a> IF you're extremely lucky to have it in HQ. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">Private Security Force<\/a> also sucks, only good for <a href=\"en\/card\/01080\">NBN<\/a> and <a href=\"en\/card\/01093\">Weyland<\/a> in the core set, but what can you do?

My turn: <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PAD Campaign's<\/a> free credit, adv+scoring <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">PSF<\/a> and two meat damage right there. His next turn had to get rid of the tags with two clicks and draw cards, thus <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01107\">PSF<\/a> can rarely be useful. What am I saying, rethinking it...it still sucks balls! <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01106\">PR<\/a> FTW in this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>A comment on a few HB cards I removed...<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, this card is useless to HB in the core set. You can't use HB for fast advancing, well maaaaybe an <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01055\">ABT<\/a> but that's pretty much it and it costs 7<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"><\/span>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01060\">Shipment from MirrorMorph<\/a>?

{"id":1003,"name":"Swiss Army Whizzard","creation":"2013-12-16 17:53:20","description":"<p>So, this is the deck I've won 2 seasons of our local league with and placed rather well in some tournaments, with only some minor alterations over the past 6 months or so. <\/p>\n\n<p>I feel this is a deck that's easy to play and difficult to master. Some of your optimal plays will be far from obvious, and it requires you to be able to read the board reasonably well. Most of the games I've lost with this come from incorrectly evaluating whether to parasite an ice or not - this is especially true when you contemplate whether to parasite something like an Archer that'll take 6 turns to die. Your most powerful plays usually require setup over multiple turns, so the corp will see them coming... but that's ok. Think of it as slowly and deliberately closing down your opponent's avenues to victory, as opposed to trying to trick out a cheap win. You have quite a few different moves you can make, many of which actually require similar tools - so even by dropping cards on the table, you're not commiting yourself to one course too much. Often-times I'll drop a nerve agent on the table just to make them ice HQ at the expense of RnD, for instance... and it's totally fine that the nerve agent will sit there unused for like 5 turns, because once its time comes, it's already been moved into position. <\/p>\n\n<p>Don't get locked into a mindset of \"I have to do X to win\". Remember - the key concept here is flexibility and multiple avenues to victory. Those deja-vus aren't in there <em>just<\/em> to recur Siphons. Sometimes you'll be able to siphon, and it'll be cool. Other-times you won't, and it'll be cool too - you can recur parasites, do multiple demo runs in one turn, recover from Archer facechecks and do all other kinds of cool stuff. Just chill, play it cool, keep your hand at 5 usable cards (if you get duplicates of Grimoire and Djinn, overdraw and ditch 'em), take some credits occasionally and you'll be fine. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:<\/strong> \nIf you don't have an econ card, mulligan. Doesn't matter which one you get (yes, even Liberated Accounts is fine), just have one. Armitage is quite possibly the best one here, because it'll give you enough sustained econ to pass the time while you draw into more econ. <\/p>\n\n<p>Early-game should be spent grabbing cheap accesses where you can and making the corp rez ICE - you have the best facechecking breaker in the game, better put it to good use. Don't be afraid to play a Datasucker and facecheck ice that's possibly going to trash it - you have three of them, and can recycle at will. If they rez, they're losing much more money than you are. If they don't, your free accesses just started enabling some of your really brutal midgame plays. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mid-game, just explore whatever openings the corp and your card draws are giving you. Possibilities include, but are not limited to: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getting a complete rig out ASAP <\/li>\n<li>running naked\/minimalistic and accessing cards left and right <\/li>\n<li>clicking through Eli to Siphon for some easy cash <\/li>\n<li>playing tag-happily, trashing Psychographics, Closed Accounts and Scorcheds with Imp to take the edge off things <\/li>\n<li>sitting back on a pile of Liberated Account credits to make it really hard for the corp to estimate where you can and can't get <\/li>\n<li>playing for time by farming datasucker counters and rezzing ice while drawing into stuff you need <\/li>\n<li>preparing for some later-turn insanity by setting up grimoire, djinn and fishing for some parts you're missing <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Late-game really depends on what you've been doing up until this point, which tools are setup and how the corp board looks. If you can't think of anything better, you can still play for time with a couple well-aimed Parasites to force frequent purges. Eventually you'll either win or lose, as is the nature of the game :) <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, for some card choice explanations: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Whizzard? Noise is so much better!\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, he really isn't. I know, I've tried. Basically, Whizzard's ability comes in handy in two situations: to dig deeper into RnD (which is a good thing) and to get dangerous things off the table without having to wait for the corp to rez 'em before it's worthwhile (which means you can be the one setting the tempo in those situations, you don't have to be the passive one). <\/p>\n\n<p>The real eye-opener to this was a random comment on BGG that went something along the lines of \"so many people say that Whizzard's ability totally shuts down their decks... good thing noone plays him.\" So I decided to change that. \nAlso, I really despise Noise's super-annoying tendency of giving you random bullshit wins in games which you lost because of your own mistakes, thus leading you to never really learning from them :) <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why no Vamp?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I used to play Vamp, it isn't worth it unless you're going all in on the strategy. Keeping someone continually at zero (which is the only scenario Vamp is really good for) requires a lot more commitment during deck construction than I was comfortable here (for one thing, it'd require a lot more econ) - I'd leave too many other cards out, and would become way too dependent on being able to get through into HQ. Keeping stuff unrezzed is neat, blowing it up after it gets rezzed is neater. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why no Joshua and no DLR?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Because I have better things to do with my time than spend click in a suboptimal fashion. To make this work, I'd have to dedicate 6 slots to it, and those 6 slots are much better used elsewhere. <\/p>\n\n<p>There is, of course, the possiblity of running just Joshua, for those matchups where I go tag-happy... but that would be 3 more cards I'd hate to draw in matchups where I really don't want to keep tags. Building to make him work in those situations would require some more moving parts. Hence, I went for flexbility instead. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Djinn isn't worth the slots\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe the ability to conjure up Medium and Nerve Agent at will is already worth 2 credits and 2 cardslots, not even counting the extra memory you're getting and the fishing for other viruses <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"2 Crypsis AND a full breaker suite?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>What can I say, I tended to be rather unlucky with my card draws, so this is to improve consistency and early thread. I used to run one Crypsis (for tutoring purposes only), but I actually did lose a game after drawing over 30 cards and still being unable to get through a goddamn Ice Wall :) <\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, if I really wanted to fit one specific card in here, the second Crypsis would be the first card to get cut. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Atman and not X?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The last 3 influence points used to be Levy, to have the ability to keep Siphoning longer... then I realized that an Atman would be a much better choice. For one, it's another breaker to draw into early, potentially giving you massive board presence. Also, it neatly solves some issues you might run into - vs. Weyland, drop it at 6 and stop caring about Archer. Vs. HB, drop it at str 4 and wave merrily as you're passing those \"taxing\" Ichis and Elis. Vs. Jinteki, take care of both Neural Katana and Wall of Static with one breaker... the list goes on. Since it's a singleton, you won't see it every game, but when you do see it, it'll be massively useful, I promise you that. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, for added hilarity, sometimes people see you play an early Atman, automatically assume you're playing three of them and then stare in shocked disbelief when you start repeatedly siphoning them (\"he can't possibly play more than one siphon, he's already spent 9 influence on Atmen!\"). Priceless, really. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Why Demolition Run?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Because Demo Run is easily one of the most underrated tools in the Anarch toolbox. I think part of that is because people keep thinking Anarch = Noise, and Demo Run seems kinda redundant with his ability. Don't be that guy. This card enables both super-deep RnD digs (the good old \"run, run, demo run, run\" turn) and shuts down combos really hard (nerve agent, surge, demo run their hand, watch 'em toss all those hoarded Biotics and weep bitter tears of despair). \nOh, and if you're playing against Jinteki, remember that Demo Run means you can nuke that Hokusai for free, while you're at it :D <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Isn't 3x Grimoire excessive?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Flexibility means options. Having options means having stuff already installed before you actually need it. Having stuff installed means needing memory. \nAlso, Grimoire is a huge Surge enabler - which brings me to... <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Surge?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, Surge. It's so massively useful I've went up to 3 Grimoires just to be able to trigger it more often. Examples: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>play a Sucker and Surge it to stop being shut out of servers after a purge <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Medium before a Demo run to pretty much deck a corp unexpectedly (this usually just fishes out 7 points before that happens, though :D) <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Nerve Agent after a Siphon run, go right back and steal all their stuff <\/li>\n<li>alternatively, the same play but with an Imp\/Demo run to get rid of the cards that could make you lose (Scorched, Psycho, possibly Closed Accounts) <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Parasite to make a Tollbooth\/whatever go <em>poof<\/em> much sooner <\/li>\n<li>Surge a Crypsis to get into that place you wouldn't be able to get into otherwise <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Tag-me with just 2 Carapaces?\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah. Either don't go into tag-me mode until you hit one (you have plenty other things to do to pass the time, like farming Armitages and installing threatening-looking stuff), or just use destruction to get rid of the cards you'd need the third Carapace against. <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Liberated Accounts is useless when tagged\"<\/em> <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>No, it's not - you just have to install it as the first action and then clear it thrice. It's basically the runner version of a Melange turn, and as an added bonus, it leaves a card on the table that's both tempting to trash and tempting to leave (and both of those options are fine with you). Same thing with Armitage, although the investment is smaller there, so you can potentially spend an Armitage just to make them spend 2 credits and a click, especially if you need to play for time for some reason. <\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n\n<p>There, that's about all that came to mind. If you have any questions, ask away!<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01002":3,"01003":2,"01006":3,"01007":2,"01008":3,"01009":2,"01010":1,"01011":2,"01012":3,"01014":2,"01018":3,"01050":3,"01051":2,"01053":3,"02001":1,"02003":2,"02009":2,"02022":3,"02041":1,"02081":2,"03040":1}},

{"id":808,"name":"Big Girls Play With Monoliths","creation":"2013-12-06 10:31:43","description":"<p>This decklist originally came into being as part of the first Turing Test over at CardGameDB - http:\/\/www.cardgamedb.com\/index.php\/index.html\/_\/android-netrunner\/turing-test-r892. If you aren't familiar with it, go have a read, it's interesting. Basically, the question was \"How fast can you conveniently have Monolith and a full breaker suite up?\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Short version: Insane card draw + Freelance Coding Contract to get a Full Rig With Monolith\u2122 set up early, then recurring siphons and RnD lock for the win. <\/p>\n\n<p>First pass through the deck should usually be chucking most programs to FCCs - don't hesitate to install what you need to apply early pressure on the corp though. Often, I'll install Magnum Opus to get Monolith out sooner - if I don't, it usually delays the big beast not because of a lack of money, but because I'll take longer to get the 3 programs to install (since I need to be chucking them to make said money). <\/p>\n\n<p>Funny thing about Monolith - it doesn't matter which programs you install with it, it always pulls its weight. Even if you do a triple Cloak play, it's still worth it: you save 3 actions and 3 credits, so valuing each click at 2 credits you're only paying 9 for Monolith - and you're getting the memory you need to make this rig work, along with a sweet \"let's facecheck cerebral overwriters and run through Januses\" ability. And this is just the worst-case scenario - most of the time, you'll be getting a much sweeter deal, with one of the cards being either a Gordian or at the very least a Dagger. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now, about the rig. It always consists of:\n- one Cloak\n- Dagger\n- Corroder\n- Gordian Blade\n- Magnum Opus<\/p>\n\n<p>That eats up 6 of your 8 available memory. The last 2 units are circumstantial:\n- If your opponent is Jinteki, you want a Net Shield\n- Unless there's a complete lack of Sentries with the 1-3 Strength range, you want a Mimic (I really can't stress just how hard this breaker owns Caduceus and Katana, two sentries that could potentially become a problem)\n- Fill the rest of your memory with Cloaks<\/p>\n\n<p>Once that happens, just establish RnD lock, recur Siphons, farm the extra copies of programs for credits or damage prevention, and you should be all set. <\/p>\n\n<p>Edit 2013\/12\/06: Added a Nerve Agent, taking out one Corroder. Basically, sacrificing early-game consistency for a solution to those moments in the late-game where it all hangs on whether they got an agenda into their hand before I established R&amp;D lock. Don't be afraid to trash a Cloak or Magnum Opus to play the Nerve Agent - most of the time, the Sure Gambles and FCCs will give you enough money to function well, and you can always install over the Nerve Agent once it has played its part.<\/p>\n","username":"PeekaySK","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01018":2,"01034":3,"01043":3,"01044":3,"01045":1,"01050":3,"02009":2,"02041":1,"02046":1,"02087":3,"02107":2,"03033":3,"03035":3,"03036":2,"03041":3,"03042":3}},

It was undefeated at 4-0 for the day.  I'll be putting together a tournament report in the near future and link it in the comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's fairly similar to the Gabe deck I've been playing for several months now, though I swapped out 3 x Parasites and 3 x Datasuckers for 3 x Knight, 1 x Mimic, an extra Armitage Codebusting, and an extra Corroder.<\/p>\n\n<p>Power Shutdown and Wraparound are the primary reasons I made the switch.  With Power Shutdown, I lost my only Corroder in a tournament last month after the Corp played back-to-back Power Shutdowns to nuke a Faerie and Corroder.  With Wraparound, I typically run a single Corroder and Parasite low-strength ETR ice until I draw into or Special Order the Corroder; a strategy that Wraparound nicely circumvents.  So the extra copy of Corroder seemed like a nice play.  The other huge benefit of running Knights is more flexibility in the early-game.  Knight plays like an Inside Job, where you're virtually guaranteed to get into a server of your choosing (useful for HQ runs with Account Siphons or Emergency Shutdowns, or for R&amp;D runs with Indexing), inevitably followed by the Corp trashing that troublesome ice to work as a pseudo-Parasite.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I'm still not sure whether I prefer the Knight version or Parasite version of this deck... each has their own pros\/cons and they're both favorites of mine.  I've only been messing with this version for a couple of weeks, so we'll see if I tend to favor one or the other after more playtime for this deck.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's the tournament report for this event:\nhttp:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1146823\/store-championship-the-yellow-king-1st-place-t<\/p>\n","username":"CrimsonWraith","cards":{"01007":2,"01011":1,"01014":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":3,"01050":3,"01053":3,"02009":3,"02043":3,"02104":3,"02106":1,"03052":3,"03054":3,"04043":3}},
{"id":2957,"name":"TWIY Astrobiotics","creation":"2014-03-08 09:38:04","description":"<p>Foreward: I'll be honest, this deck is dumb. If you want to have fun with quirky shenanigans, this isn't for you. Astrobiotics is a quintessential Spike deck. My opponents have left once they see what I'm doing, they've flamed how much of a bore it is, and I've scared away a couple of new players (sorry! I do always put [Adv] in my OCTGN room :\/). This deck has an extremely hard time losing.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've spent months analyzing TWIY trying to figure out how to unlock its true potential. Many conclusions I've drawn won't be new to many (Biotic Laboring a Astroscript is teh shit), but many I haven't seen reflected as much as I think should. Anyways, let's begin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I'm going to make a bold claim: TWIY improves as the deck approaches 40 cards. TWIY is all about consistency and speed - the more you fine-tune both, the better your deck becomes (even if only marginally - it adds up). There's nothing worse than spending half your game drawing without seeing an Astroscript or fast advance tool<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, as many of you are aware, cutting to 40 cards increases your agenda density and you lack the deckspace needed to incorporate ice, econ, and the tools you need, causing some opening hands to lose the game for you. Anonymous Tip was designed for TWIY. Running three of them, you have a 40% chance of starting with one, granting you an eight-card starting hand. Anonymous Tip provides opening flexibility - its deckslot functions not only as a draw accelerator, but also as either ice or economy since it gives you a second opportunity in a bad opening hand. This Andromeda-like effect all but eliminated bad openings in this deck (too bad it doesn't come with an improved mulligan).<\/p>\n\n<p>So what constitutes a good opening hand? Here are cards to mulligan for (in order):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Biotic Labor<\/li>\n<li>Astroscript Pilot Program<\/li>\n<li>Ice #1<\/li>\n<li>Anonymous Tip<\/li>\n<li>Econ #1<\/li>\n<li>Ice #2<\/li>\n<li>SanSan City Grid (moves up vs Gabe)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Your one and only objective is to get that Astrochain rollin'. If you have a Beale in HQ and don't suspect Siphon, leave it undefended. If that Beale is an Astroscript, protect it (I swear, the fact tihs deck exists angers the Gods of luck). Biotic Labor is the most sure-fire way to score your first Astroscript (and allows an alternate scoring method if your Astros get stolen), at only 5c if you use SfSS (which is also helpful against denial decks such as Reina or Gabe). I would not recommend switching SfSS for Subliminal Messaging or Restructure, as it greatly increasses your scoring window - something that I think has been undervalued.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that's right, no Jackson. Every time he showed in an opening hand, I was disappointed. I'll consider re-adding him if Noise gets the help he needs (never thought I'd be saying that). Data Raven is here because TWIY Scorch decks put the fear of God into runners, so they either never run that server again, find methods of bypassing it, or they run much more slowly and remove the tags. Very rarely have I encountered a runner willing to eat the tags without digging for a Plascrete first. I do however, intend to switch it for the spoiled Sentry ETR that can't be bypassed, and swapping Enigmas for Quandry.<\/p>\n\n<p>This deck, if piloted properly without the worst possible draws, keeps the runner at phase two of the game (ice is out, but runner is still searching for breakers). My average game length is 8-11 turns, with about 10 cards left in R&amp;D. Good luck with it!<\/p>\n","username":"Lysander","cards":{"01059":2,"01064":2,"01081":3,"01082":2,"01083":3,"01088":2,"01092":3,"01101":1,"01110":3,"01111":3,"02060":2,"02114":1,"02115":3,"04034":2,"04039":2,"04076":3,"04095":1,"04096":3}},

{"id":3946,"name":"Replicating Kills v1.0 (a  guide how to play RP properly)","creation":"2014-04-07 08:50:24","description":"<p>Hello everyone, this is the first Jinteki deck that I publish. A thing to know about me, is that I play <em>only<\/em> Jinteki, as a corp, ever since I started in September last year and yes... I guess that makes me \"that Jinteki player\" in your local playgroup. I have a lot of experience with the corp though, so let me share with you a deck I'm really excited about.<\/p>\n\n<h1>General Mindset<\/h1>\n\n<p>This deck wants to drain you from money, making you an easy target for Punitive Counterstrike (which I will refer to as PS from now on). In order to do this we have : <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>6 out of 9 agendas requiring you to spend money (and draw cards, cuz Neural EMP and PS pew-pew) <\/li>\n<li>Expensive to bypass Ice ( especially if Ninja is the dominant breaker in your playgroup rather than mimic) <\/li>\n<li>Economy that punishes passive runners but makes aggressive ones lose clicks\/time <\/li>\n<li>Caprice to make them \"re-run\" your already expensive server or to deny them a bit more gold and make them unable to steal your agenda bellow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note: You will do yourself a big favor, thinking that the runner will win the game with 3 agendas rather than 4, because you play 3 pointers. Better prepare yourself for that, rather than blaming it on \"luck\".<\/p>\n\n<h1>Agendas Spread<\/h1>\n\n<p>In the abstract above I've described in general the Agenda choice. However, there are a bit of space to play around. <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You want the Fetal AI and the NAPD to drain them even more than the already taxing ICE. Fetal AI also makes them easier to finish off with PS or Neural EMP <\/li>\n<li>You want Priority Req, because it makes easier to ress the expensive ICE and allows you to really hammer them with PS. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Things to play around with :<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The current agenda pool is 21 points (rather than 20) and it's possible to change that. <\/li>\n<li>In the first version of this deck I had a single Clone retirement that I used for Archer rezzing, removing the bad pub from grim AND scoring from hand to finish 6 point games. It's a really valuable choice for this deck, the reason I don't play it is because with the new cards from \"Double Time\" it's possible to reinforce the money denial tactic. <\/li>\n<li>Take out a Priority Req and put in a Braintrust. It lowers the the chance for them hitting a 3 pointer + now they don't know if you put an unadvanced card if it's an upgrade, a Snare! or a braintrust!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>Economy<\/h1>\n\n<p>Plain and simple &ndash; expensive to trash and punishes passive runners <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I choose Private Contracts over PAD campaign in this deck, because it allows you to surge your money when you need it. You can take 6 money for 1 turn. PAD is possible to do the same, however you need to have 3 copies of it our and rezzed, rather than a single one (which is the case with Private Contracts). You want to be able to surge with money, so you can prepare your PS! <\/li>\n<li>Sundew is a monster. Especially in RP. If the runner doesn't address EVERY single one which you install, they will leave you swimming in money <\/li>\n<li>Subliminal is sick in RP. Arguable a deck that has 3 Snares, 3 Fetals and 3 Shocks and 3 Celebrity Gifts would like Subliminal more, however making them unable to run your remote on their last click really discourages them have to spend the one before that for fictive archives run. I might try Celebrity Gift in this deck at some point, but I'm happy with the economy atm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>ICE<\/h1>\n\n<p>Now here is where you might not agree with many of my choices, but let me go through them! <\/p>\n\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Low barrier numbers. Jinteki never had any good barriers to begin with. Generally unless u plan to spend 3 influence for a Heimdal 2.0 or get Bastions in, there isn't really a point to it. Corroder <em>is<\/em> the best breaker in game ( even among the different types) and they <em>will<\/em> have it. The reason I'm playing Himitso-Bako over a Bastion or a Paper Wall is because it allows me to move it around. I would generally use it to protect Sundews or\/and Private Contracts and I can move it around if I manage to trash their Corroders. I might wanna play 3 in this deck actually, but hard to take find a card slot. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Note: Why Wall of Thorns is a bad ICE.<\/h3>\n\n<p>I've seen people uploading \"winning\" decks with WoTx2 and I really find myself face palming. That ICE is just horrid. Let's take a closer look at it. First, it costs 4 or 5 to get through with Corrroder and it has a cost of 8. Which means it needs at least 2 runs through it, to pay off. That's not efficient, when Tollbooth costs 7 on a Gordian Blade for the same price (and they lose 3c regardless)! Second it has Net Damage and End the Run. The two subroutines are almost mutually exclusive. You either want them to take Net damage and kill them or to stop them in their feet and end the run. Doing both puts you nowhere. They either don't take the extra damage from the Agenda\/Trap\/Hokusai bellow or just continue to Agenda win for 4 credits ( to break the End the Run sub). Tsurugi gets around this problem very gracefully by - having a lower rezz cost, more net damage and allowing YOU to control the outcome. If you find yourself in a position to trash their Corroder it doesn't really matter if you have Himitsu-Bako or WoT. Conclusion - don't play Wall of Thorns!  <\/p>\n\n<h2>Sentries<\/h2>\n\n<p>Really expensive for Ninja. Neural Katana is 4 for 4. Tsurugi is 6 for 7 and Archer is 9\/10. Mimic is the worst thing that can happen to a Jinteki player, however that's why Archer and Grimm come in. IF you trash 1 of their mimics and discard the other via Net damage, it's suddenly another game :) <\/p>\n\n<h2>Code Gates<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Viper for 1 Influence is great in RP deck (because it makes them lose a click) it fits well both on remote and as top ice on a central. Yagura is <em>amazing<\/em> and does some work that ICE ( that's the reason I don't wanna put the Quandary in) , especially in front of R&amp;D. <\/li>\n<li>Tollbooth &mdash; still one of the best ICE in game, it does kneel a bit for 5 against a Knight, but everything else makes through it slowly and expensive (which is the thing u want!) <\/li>\n<li>Chum + Data mine &mdash; it will catch people off-guard. The combo will allow you to kill people easily (especially if DM is out of your Meta atm) and the cards on their own work great in this deck. Chum boosting Grim for double Ninja pump or getting Tsurugi and Neural katana out of Mimic range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h1>The other cards<\/h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Caprice Nisei , is just a <em>strong<\/em> card. It's not as game breaking as many people call it, because there is a chance in the game as it is (Hi there Maker's eye), but it will see play in pretty much every Jinteki deck from now on. It works great for this deck as well, because sometimes biding 2, knowing them that if they bid 2 they will be out of the money range to steal the agenda bellow &mdash; is <em>skill<\/em> , not luck! <\/li>\n<li>My initial deck didn't have Interns in it. However Caprice is a viable target to be sniped from R&amp;D so you will want her back <em>and<\/em> installing 3rd or 4th layer of ICE for free, is just great. <\/li>\n<li>Jackson x 2 ... You get around 3 \"free\" influence in this deck and Jack seems to be the best target, as pretty much the \"all mighty fixer\" making you draw into what u want and fixing overdrawing problems meanwhile. A good play is, leaving 5 points in archives (if they are at 0) preparing for a PS and Neural EMPs in your turn after knowing that it will kill them. If they score a 2 pointer or something changes your plan in the meantime (like a Plascrete) just Jackson them back in :) <\/li>\n<li>Ronin &mdash; maybe the most arguable card in this deck, but there is a reason for it. Maybe you are thinking \"Why not run a Junebug in always advance deck\" and you would be correct, if every good player didn't run at least 1 Infiltration or other expose in their decks. The card slots are so tight atm, that I don't have the space to put in 1-2 Zaibatsu Loyalties or Tricks of Light, to make the Junebug useful after it's exposed. Ronin on the other hand, even if it's exposed and lies protected in the remote behind 2-3 layers of ICE, they <em>have<\/em> to address it, because that 3 extra damage in a <strong>kill<\/strong> deck a good player can't leave. And all that for just 2 card slots!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE<\/strong>: I <em>want<\/em> Hokusai in this deck !! xD I want at least 2 Hokusai's in the deck, because they worked great in the previous version of the deck (let's call it the beta) comboing hard with Fetals and will go good with NAPD making them not trash the Grid when they enter :) However, I can't see to find slots because I want at least 15 ICE (previous version was with 17!) in RP ! An idea I'm having is to go to 54 cards for 22 points. That will result in 1 Clone retirement, 2x Hokusai and leave me with 2 slots for ICE. Don't know how consistent the deck will be though for drawing into Neural EMPs, PSs and Ronins. Will definitely try both and update for v2.0!<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have reached this point in this \"article\", thank you!

{"id":5136,"name":"The Thing That Should Not Be","creation":"2014-05-06 15:58:15","description":"<p>This is my Harmony Medtech build, and it is a beast. It's current record is 12-1 (the only loss came from a friend playing it for the first time against me) and shows no sign of slowing down. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main advantage of this ID is that it provides no opportunity for the runner to slow down and regain control. The runner has to constantly maintain pressure lest he be outscored in 3-4 turns. This leads to runners making mistakes they wouldn't normally make. I usually win by scoring 6 points (it's alarmingly easy), but I have often won by kill too. Interestingly, if you notice, going for the kill is not the aim of this deck. Instead, damage is simply used to slow the runner down. But, funny things can happen like killing the runner with Yagura :P<\/p>\n\n<p>Agendas:<\/p>\n\n<p>Braintrust - Simply a 3\/2 agenda that gets points. Sucks a little when these get stolen<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Breakthrough - This card is GOOD, like Astro good. Honestly, you kind of want the first one to get stolen. That brings down the next one to a 3\/2, and then you can fast track the other one for an easy 2\/2. One game, threw 2 of these and MHC down in open remotes. Runner hit 1 of them (just like I hoped), then on my turn, got a buck from MHC and scored the other. Next turn, scored the other from hand and we were at match point. That just feels good :)<\/p>\n\n<p>NAPD Contract - Everybody knows this agenda is awesome and in here is works great. Because of how much pressure the runner is under, they often have just enough money to get into a server. I have seen many NAPD\u2019s just stared at and put back down. <\/p>\n\n<p>Philotic Entanglement - God, kills me that this is only a 1 per deck! Again, another 3\/2 and it slows the runner down if they scored anything. While I prefer to score this if they have already stolen 1-2 agendas, but I\u2019ll score it right away if need. You are preferably scoring an agenda at least every 1-2 turns, 3 at the most.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assets:<\/p>\n\n<p>Jackson Howard - What can be said? He does whatever you need. Draw, archive saves, etc. He also works great as a bluff. I rarely end up keeping him on the board long, so I\u2019ll stick him in a protected server and let the runner run it thinking he\u2019s an agenda. This tactic works great in this deck. Everything starts to look like an agenda. <\/p>\n\n<p>Mental Health Clinic - This is a fun card. Again, I\u2019m not trying to flatline the runner, so the 1 plus card doesn\u2019t bother me. Instead the runner is faced with a problem: let me have 1 credit or spend 3 and not get an extra card\u2026. hmmm  :) I\u2019ll also use this as a bluff<\/p>\n\n<p>Snare! - Again, slow them down and make them fear you. It can kill, but usually not unless is gets pulled towards the end of the game when they get desperate and reckless. I sometimes use this as an agenda bluff, but only if the runner has proven that they will run everything that I lay down. Otherwise, keep it in hand for when Celebrity shows up. <\/p>\n\n<p>Upgrades:<\/p>\n\n<p>Caprice Nisei - She is boss. Shoot, often I\u2019ll throw her down,immediately rezz and the runner ignores that server the rest of the game. Perfect\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>SanSan City Grid - Strictly speaking, you don\u2019t NEED this to win, but it sure helps. At the very least, you soak up 5 credits on the trash. Then you just Jackson it back in...<\/p>\n\n<p>Operations:<\/p>\n\n<p>Celebrity Gift - Not much to say. Makes money when you don\u2019t have a lot. <\/p>\n\n<p>Fast Track - This is pretty recent addition. I found that I was often digging for the last agenda I needed. Now I can just tutor it up into a hand of Snares and operations<\/p>\n\n<p>Hedge Fund - Yup<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical Research Fundraiser - So, most people have been going back and forth on this card. I like it a lot, but only in the right situation. You have to be careful when you play. If the runner ended their turn with 0-3 credits, then DO NOT play this card. The better time to play this is when the runner is already flush with credits and getting 3 more won\u2019t make much difference. Typically anything over 10 and I\u2019ll play it if I need it. Again, another thing a lot of corps seem to forget is that you shouldn't be blowing through all your money cards as soon as they hit your hand. Hang onto them until you need them. They pad out your HQ and can surprise the runner. <\/p>\n\n<p>ICE:<\/p>\n\n<p>Wall of Static - Go get your Corroder buddy\u2026.<\/p>\n\n<p>Quandary - Go get your Yog<\/p>\n\n<p>Yagura - A great little piece of ice, best on R&amp;D of course<\/p>\n\n<p>Grim - Use this to trash whatever will slow down the runner the most. <\/p>\n\n<p>Guard - Perfect for remote servers and sneaking out an agenda. Also forces a sentry break to come out<\/p>\n\n<p>Komainu - I didn't know what to think of this before, but I freaking love this ice! Sure, it dies to Parasite but no ice is perfect. No matter what, this ice puts a hardship on the runner. Pay 5 credits to get through with a full hand, or drop dangerously low to make it cheap. Interestingly, half the card is taxing, the other half sets up a kill. Very cool <\/p>\n\n<p>Pup - Taxing. Love it. Put it on R&amp;D<\/p>\n\n<p>Swordsman - This is my little surprise ice. If nobody is playing Atman or Knight or Crypsis or Overmind, then you don\u2019t need it. But I\u2019m going to hazard a guess and say that those are showing up a lot these days. :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Tsurugi - Taxing. Also, slim chance, but can setup a kill too. Great ice<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, still playing around with the exact composition of everything (thinking about how Mushin can fit into the deck and possibly Shi.Ky\u016b) but I\u2019m pretty stinking happy with how it is performing currently.

If you really hate NEH Astrobiotics, give this deck a shot!)<\/p>\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n<p>It was only early this year when I started to really get serious about Netrunner. A couple friends and I had decided to carpool around the Store Championship circuit in LA, pulled in by the allure of promo Kati Jones and Wotan playmats. I believe we ended up hitting up five tournaments: Hypno Comics in Ventura, Gameology in Montclair, Majestix CCG in Costa Mesa, Aero Hobbies in Santa Monica, and Brookhurst Hobbies in Garden Grove. It was a really fun experience that led to a lot of growth for me as a Netrunner player.<\/p>\n\n<p>Up to this point, I had heavily favored Anarchs and Shapers on the runner side. I had dismissed Criminals as boring - their style of \"win fast\" has always been very powerful, but it tends to lead to the same cookie-cutter decks. To make things worse, the Criminal cardpool probably has the highest power disparity of any faction. It's hard to make a creative yet competitive Criminal deck when a few elite, game-defining cards (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01024\">Desperado<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01018\">Account Siphon<\/a>, etc.) are surrounded by an ocean of mediocrity. Perhaps for these reasons, I think that Criminals never quite caught on in LA as much as elsewhere; many of our competitive players also value originality very highly. But Honor &amp; Profit really broadened the cardpool and helped alleviate these issues. I think each of the H&amp;P runners has acquired a sizable following here.<\/p>\n\n<p>I no longer remember the corp deck I played at the first store championship, but as my runner I used a Whizzard <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02021\">Vamp<\/a>-<a href=\"\/en\/card\/01010\">Medium<\/a> deck that I have been messing around with for a long time. It was a lot of fun, but unfortunately the deck was slow enough that my matches would frequently go to time. Even worse, the NBN fast advance decks that were rising to prominence were a pretty awful matchup. (<a href=\"\/en\/card\/04096\">Wraparound<\/a> was a huge hassle for all of my numerous AI-based decks to deal with.) After a lackluster finish at Ventura, I finally decided that I was tired of handicapping my runner game. The World Is Yours* was both fast and consistent, and to beat it I had to match both. It was time to build my own <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/966226\/so-cal-regionals-1st-place-runner-deck\">Typical Solid Criminal Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Criminal deck I ended up with could probably be described as a Gabe control deck; instead of throwing all of its eggs into the SIphon basket like <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/1008864\/deck\">most contemporary Criminal builds<\/a>, it could hold its own in a long game thanks to the duo of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02091\">Kati<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02105\">Mr. Li<\/a>. That deck helped me win me the next Store Championship. One of my opponents told me that it was the best runner economic engine he had ever faced. My Criminal-innocence-bubble had been popped once and for all.<\/p>\n\n<p>(I have since learned to enjoy the Criminal playstyle. That's especially true now that corp decks are a real challenge to defeat; the constant danger of falling behind added much-needed zest to the Criminal game. The current competitive Shaper decks feel boring to me in comparison.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Flash forward half a year to October. The release of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04119\">NAPD Contract<\/a>, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05027\">Fast Track<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06005\">Near-Earth Hub<\/a>, along with the widespread adoption of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01059\">Biotic Labor<\/a>, have turned NBN into a monster. I am struggling to find a runner deck that even can come close to competing with all of the top corp decks. I had tried the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06056\">Supplier<\/a> version of <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/profile\/2459\/Nordrunner\">Nordrunner<\/a>'s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MvDyvveCEog\">President\/CEO<\/a> and a personal version of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04029\">PPVP<\/a> Kate, but disliked both. I had a Ken blitz deck with an excellent NEH matchup, but it usually ran out of steam against slower decks. I had an <a href=\"http:\/\/teamcovenant.com\/botounami\/2014\/05\/20\/anatomy-of-anarchy\/\">\"Anatomy of Anarchy\"<\/a> Quetzal build that was pretty good but probably could never beat Blue Sun, and a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02101\">Retrieval Run<\/a> Quetzal build that wasn't fast enough for NEH while <em>also<\/em> probably never beating Blue Sun.<\/p>\n\n<p>At last, it was time to revisit good old Gabe.<\/p>\n\n<p>My old controllish deck was no longer well-positioned in the new meta - NEH Astrobiotics is way too fast for you to fool around with shady guys like <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02105\">Mr. Li<\/a>. Instead, I synthesized the deck with some new ideas. From the Ken deck I adopted <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05048\">Security Testing<\/a> for economy, <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05046\">Passport<\/a> to get through <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06003\">Lotus Field<\/a>, and some impactful singletons that I had liked. From AoA I borrowed the idea of using <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> to ensure access for Siphon. After all that, I even had space for a few more meta choices!<\/p>\n\n<p>The result, I feel, was a fairly balanced deck that manages to have an excellent matchup against Near-Earth Hub.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Strategy<\/h2>\n\n<p>The most common question about any serious Gabe deck will probably be, \"Why not Andy?\" Honestly, the choice of identity largely comes down to personal preference. It's clearly possible to make an excellent and very similar Andy build with these cards. But I still think there are some strategic considerations that would lead me to pick Gabe over Andy. If I had to name a Netrunner strategy that will never be bad, I would say having lots of credits. A rich runner can steal NAPDs, trash assets, and generally get into servers when they <em>need<\/em> to get in. And as it turns out, Gabe is really great at getting rich.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gabe's identity power also puts immense pressure on HQ from turn 1. The corp has to protect HQ ASAP, and then Archives, and then continue to guard HQ with unrezzed ice to play around Account Siphon. That amount of ice costs lots of time and money to set up, which often leads to some number of easy R&amp;D accesses in the early game. That's a big advantage against NEH, where the game generally comes down to how many efficient accesses the runner can snatch from the centrals. If you draw it, an early <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02106\">Indexing<\/a> can decide the entire game.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, Gabe's increased efficiency at attacking HQ means that the corp's hand stays vulnerable throughout the entire game. Hence, he doesn't need HQ multi-access to compete against NEH in the same way that practically every other runner does - although <a href=\"\/en\/card\/05035\">Legwork<\/a> wouldn't be a terrible inclusion here either.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Card choices<\/h2>\n\n<ul><li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/01029\">Bank Job<\/a> is making a huge comeback, because in the current meta it's a quick and enormously efficient economy card that will rarely backfire. Along with Security Testing, a Criminal player can turn any open remote server into their own economy engine. <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02063\">Scrubber<\/a> is another very solid card right now. It especially shines against RP, where pretty much every card the corp plays is something that you have to trash. It's not quite as good against NEH, so I ended up dropping down to one copy to fit in the third Bank Job.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>No <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapaces<\/a> because I really dislike pure hate cards. When runners were dominant, it made much more sense to hedge one's bets by playing Plascrete. But in the current environment, any dead card against Astrobiotics is too much of a liability, especially in a deck with very few draw effects. Feel free to add Plascretes as your meta dictates, but I prefer to take some risks and play around Scorched Earth when necessary.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Three each of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01021\">Inside Job<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02043\">Emergency Shutdown<\/a>. Here are the Blue Sun hate cards. A well-timed Shutdown can really set Blue Sun back, while Inside Job lets you jump over a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04078\">Curtain Wall<\/a> to land a Shutdown or steal an agenda. Conveniently, they both happen to be excellent cards in their own right and are far from useless in other matchups. But I happened to dodge all of the other Blue Sun players at Worlds, so I still don't understand this matchup very well. It's possible that these cards aren't impactful enough, and that the slots could be better spent on other cards.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/05053\">Overmind<\/a> is the component of the deck that I remain least certain about. It is annoying to play before Desperado or after other programs, and it becomes unplayable once most of your breaker suite is assembled. Still, a backup AI breaker has a ton of synergy with the Criminal playstyle, and Overmind seems like the best AI breaker available right now. (Sadly, I think <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01051\">Crypsis<\/a> has become too slow for the current meta.)<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><a href=\"\/en\/card\/02006\">Peacock<\/a> is the decoder we need, not the decoder we deserve. I think every deck wants some way of getting past Lotus Field on a remote - a <em>very<\/em> common corp play after the runner has played or discarded a Passport - and Peacock is not much less efficient than <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01043\">Gordian Blade<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02007\">ZU.13 Key Master<\/a> for practically every code gate seeing play right now. As long as you have enough cash, Peacock lets you get in when you have to, and that meshes very well with Gabe's playstyle.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The deck is rounded out with some out-of-faction 1-ofs that aren't strictly necessary for the deck to function, but are still always nice to draw. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01008\">Datasucker<\/a> is an MVP at getting past <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/02110\">Eli<\/a> or high-strength sentries efficiently. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01012\">Parasite<\/a> destroys whatever the most troublesome ice is at the moment, and is especially handy against Replicating Perfection. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02087\">Quality Time<\/a> is a nice singleton because it is awkward to draw in multiples, whereas the first copy is pretty much always great to draw.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If I somehow managed to free up 2 influence, the first card I would look at adding is the 2nd <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02107\">R&amp;D Interface<\/a>. Having access to R&amp;D multi-access is very important, and the deck is a little light on that front right now.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>Playing tips<\/h2>\n\n<ul><li><p>If you've never seen it before, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/966226\/so-cal-regionals-1st-place-runner-deck\">my all-time favorite Netrunner strategy article<\/a>. Although the individual card choices may be a little outdated now, jopejope still provided a timeless explanation of the nuances to playing any aggressive runner.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Against NEH, I tend to trash rezzed <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01109\">PADs<\/a> but leave <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02055\">Marked Accounts<\/a> around for Bank Jobs. Always trash <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01092\">SanSan<\/a> if the corp will have enough money on their turn to threaten scoring with it. It's often possible to get an extra R&amp;D access by threatening to trash <a href=\"\/en\/card\/04015\">Jackson<\/a>. Try to play <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01011\">Mimic<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02104\">Faerie<\/a> before encountering unrezzed ice, and don't run on unrezzed ice on your last click if you don't have a killer (or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/06061\">Architect<\/a> will absolutely ruin your day).<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The RP matchup is a drawn-out attrition war, further complicated in a tournament environment by the fact that you'll have to play really quickly. Keep their economy down for as long as possible by trashing assets and using Emergency Shutdown. Hope for good early accesses. When the centrals become unprofitable, find Kati Jones and pile up credits. \"Take 3, put 3 on Kati\" is a turn that you might have to get used to. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03052\">Dirty Laundry<\/a> could be a good addition to help fight <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/06022\">Enhanced Login Protocol<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Against Blue Sun, you'll have to acquire a good sense for when you can pressure safely and when running will likely get you killed. Hope to snag some agenda points while you can still run. Try to have Shutdown ready when they make an <a href=\"\/en\/cards\/02079\">Oversight AI<\/a> play. Kati Jones will once again be crucial for winning a credit war in the long game.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Unfortunately, the PE shell game matchup is something of a crapshoot. Luck and player skill are the most important factors here, so if you're facing a skilled PE player you're probably in a heap of trouble. Learn to play carefully while still taking calculated risks. Account Siphon is a key card because Jinteki lacks fangs while broke. Identify which other cards are important to play out and which cards should be held back as net damage fodder - remember that you don't need too many credits against this deck.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>Summary<\/h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps more than most Netrunner decks, this deck is a product of its time. In a few months, I have serious doubts that this particular configuration would still be well-positioned. But, as I said above, being rich will never be a bad strategy, so I believe that the Consummate Professional will always be a reasonable choice. His unparalleled ability to punish bad draws is especially powerful right now while the corp is advantaged. That's because a well-constructed Gabe deck should always be able to get some number of wins by capitalizing on an early stumble from the corp. Andromeda, on the other hand, becomes comparatively better while the runner is favored, because her higher consistency reduces the number of losses from sheer bad luck.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's why now is a great time for the non-Andy Criminals to shine. Make the NEH players realize that they are far from invincible. See to it that <em>your<\/em> name is written on the moon.<\/p>\n","username":"tmoiynmwg","cards":{"01007":2,"01008":1,"01011":1,"01012":1,"01017":1,"01018":3,"01021":3,"01022":3,"01024":3,"01026":1,"01028":2,"01029":3,"01050":3,"02006":1,"02043":3,"02063":1,"02087":1,"02091":2,"02104":2,"02106":1,"02107":1,"03054":1,"05046":1,"05048":3,"05053":2}}

The recommended starter decks in the core set aren\u2019t very efficient nor do they use any influence, so I have worked with some friends to design a few starter decks. Every starter deck is made of a single core set and we have also made variants with no 1-of cards so anyone with 3 core-sets can throw together these starter decks and have them lying around to introduce new players.

Since this is a beginner deck we didn\u2019t want to use search as new players would have no idea what ice breakers they should even search for. Instead we put in enough breakers that you are bound to hit them pretty quickly.

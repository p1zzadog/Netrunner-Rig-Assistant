{"id":26640,"name":"Clotline Bling - 1st GLC Finals \/ 2nd ChiLo Grudge Match","creation":"2015-09-22 14:48:32","description":"<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UPEJFyD--ck\">\u266c  <em>\"You used to fast advance your Astros..\"<\/em>  \u266c<\/a><\/h4>\n\n<p>I brought this deck to Chicago's Netrunner weekend extravaganza, with the ChiLo City Grudge Match \/ Great Lakes Circuit Last Chance Qualifiers (an ANR Pro Circuit event) on Saturday, and the GLC finals on Sunday. It went into ChiLo's Top 8 as the top seed (44 players), eventually taking 2nd place. At the GLC finals (24 players), the deck went into the Top 4 as the fourth seed, going undefeated and winning me $500 -- paired with my <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/22033\/heaven-knows-i-m-miserable-now-warren-regionals-1st-place\">Detroit winnings<\/a>, I'm pretty sure this makes me the highest-paid pro Netrunner player :P<\/p>\n\n<p>The deck's record for the entire weekend was 12-3, with two losses to Spags' NEH TS\/TB (three wins tho), and one to Travis Chance's Argus. That seems pretty good! Especially  considering the events attracted the best players from seven different states, including many regional winners, T16 Nationals players, T16 Worlds players, etc. I really wanted to bring Noise to the U.S. Nationals this year but stuck with Whizzard since I didn't have any practice with the former, and I regretted it after the Master Gamer completely failed me. I immediately picked up Noise after Nationals to see if I can play him adequately.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/><h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UPEJFyD--ck\">\u266c  <em>\"Late night when you need that win\"<\/em>  \u266c<\/a><\/h4>\n\n<p>Ohio is filled with strong Noise players who are better and more experienced with him than me, so I had to rely on watching their games, asking for their advice, and running ideas\/card choices by them to figure out how to play the ID. Much thanks to those guys! I also learned a lot playing against Pacer at Nationals and watching his games. Like most other modern Noise decks, this uses <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/24158\/good-things-on-sale-stranger-1st-place-plano-tx-regionals\">hi_impact's Good Things on Sale build<\/a> as a base.<\/p>\n\n<p>My build is closest to Josh (1.0) Wilson's, though, as I tried to take a lot of his ideas and make it work with my play style. Both Cyber Feeder and Daily Casts help make waiting for Aesop to show up bearable. The single I've Had Worse is good for surviving some damage, fueling Faust, and drawing for pieces. I hate losing Deja Vus and important pieces to Street Peddler, so I only have two -- Josh doesn't play any, but he draws more aggressively than I do. The two Clots are critical. I wish I could fit in a third Lamprey, so I can headlock easier when those opportunities come up.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/><h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UPEJFyD--ck\">\u266c  <em>\"I know when that Clotline Bling..\"<\/em>  \u266c<\/a><\/h4>\n\n<p>I've heard Noise has a weak match-up to Team Sponsorship HB and NEH, but I never felt like I didn't have control against the former, and I got better and better against the latter as the weekend progressed against the latter. It's obvious, but just check every remote, recur Clot, drop Faust if they try to score behind ICE, recur Clot, maximize Aesop use every turn, recur Clot, keep extras of Wyldside and Aesop in hand, recur Clot, check archives after a virus wipe, recur Clot, poke the weakest centrals, and recur Clot. You don't even need to Imp the Team Sponsorships sometimes (or SanSan City Grids!) since they're never going to score once you're setup.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tremendous thanks to everyone who helped organize the absolutely stellar ChiLo and GLC events, along with everyone who ran and participated in ANRPC tournaments. Big ups to the generous folks who made\/brought special prizes to share with the community (Tony Sarkees, Jack Otto, Joseph Man).

It's not that far off from <a href=\"http:\/\/netrunnerdb.com\/en\/decklist\/22034\/perfection-replicated-fast-warren-mi-regionals-1st-place\">the list that won Detroit's regional<\/a> and Top 3'd Chicago's regional, with adjustments made to adapt as the meta evolves. I don't think I want to leave the Ichi in. Though Viper does a lot of work against Faust (decent against Gordian Blade too), it will probably be swapped for Global Food Initiative. I'll take out Hades Fragment for that switch too since you almost always lose the game when that agenda is stolen, but it saved me from being milled out against Valencia with the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/2netdamage\/status\/641257010533560320\">fuck boy starter pack<\/a> last weekend.<\/p>\n\n<p>This isn't the most consistent or safe RP list. My plan is to get a little money, lightly protect centrals, drop an ICE and Caprice, then start scoring. Fast track helps the Nisei train get going or keep going. You have to be great at Psi games to win with this! Really, it's difficult on the corp side to be bad at Psi games considering you're almost always favored to win them. This deck happens to just force a lot of them, particularly game-winning Psi bets.<\/p>\n\n<p>I lost in ChiLo's finals because Spags figured me out and out-Psi'd me twice in a row -- hey, Jordan had trouble with the Pistons, too. Josh (widely known as the Kobe Bryant of Psi games, after patterning his style after mine) made fun of me all weekend for getting exposed, so I came back the next day to GLC's finals with an evolved game, went hard in the paint, and swept the series\/cut.

Instead Shrike with <a href=\"\/en\/card\/09040\">Multithreader<\/a> results in efficient sentry clear.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm surprised every game how quickly my rig is set up and ready to cut through any server. The combination of <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01035\">Modded<\/a> get's everything out for cheap.

Super self explanatory and efficient.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Early game:<\/strong> It is super rare to have a \"bad hand\" with this deck. I've rarely had to mulligan. Install <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03053\">Daily Casts<\/a> and draw for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01044\">Magnum Opus<\/a>. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01004\">Stimhack<\/a> early game to eatheer blow up a server or, more often use the 9 to pop a couple <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03046\">SMC's<\/a> and get that rig out.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mid Game:<\/strong> Install all the things. Nothing is useless and game specific so if you can <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01035\">Modded<\/a> out <a href=\"\/en\/card\/09040\">Multithreader<\/a>, Do It! This point of the game is all about taking a relatively slow deck and making it fast. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/01034\">Diesel<\/a> first click and <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02049\">Personal Workshop<\/a> everything drawn is a common turn.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>End Game:<\/strong> Your Time. Running is free and HQ and R&amp;D are doomed. The Corp has lost the fun in rezzing ice, knowing that it will be free for you to break it. This deck has skipped through many a Blue Sun server with ease.  <\/p>\n\n<p><em>Replacements:<\/em> I've cut the <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03037\">Feedback Filter<\/a> for a <a href=\"\/en\/card\/02009\">Plascrete Carapace<\/a> or <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03040\">Atman<\/a> in the past, I just had enough of Personal Evolution and Cybernetics Division hurting my brain and the Atman would just sit in my hand most of the time. <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03053\">Daily Casts<\/a> is the next weakest card and have swapped it for <a href=\"\/en\/card\/03052\">Dirty Laundry<\/a> in the past.<\/p>\n\n<p>As Always, any advice is appreciated.
